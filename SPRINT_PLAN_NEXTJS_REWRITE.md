# SpaceSnap Web — Next.js/TypeScript Rewrite Sprint Plan

Stack: Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL + NextAuth (or custom JWT/session auth) + React Query + Tailwind + AWS (Elastic Beanstalk/RDS/S3 or Vercel, TBD)

Replaces the Laravel + Vite/React (JS) stack entirely. Not the parallel-build model anymore — this becomes the primary product once Sprint 7 verification passes. Old Laravel repo stays untouched/read-only as reference and rollback point until this rewrite is fully verified.

Not funded by or claimed under the Startup SG Tech POC grant.

**Ground rule carried over from the original build:** every known gap found in the original data integrity audit gets fixed *at the point it's built*, not discovered later. See "Known gaps to close" in each relevant sprint below — these are not new scope, they're re-implementing what you already learned the first time.

---

## Sprint 0: Environment & Architecture Decisions

- [x] Next.js project init (App Router, TypeScript template)
- [x] Decide: Next.js API routes
- [x] Decide: Prisma (raw SQL fallback for constraints Prisma can't express)
- [x] Decide: NextAuth — this decision shapes Sprint 3, don't defer it
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL (reuse existing schema/dump from Laravel version as starting point)
- [x] Git repo init, `.env` + `.env.example` conventions
- [x] Tailwind config with existing design tokens ported over (colors, radii, fonts — see Design Theme doc)
- [x] Railway + R2 stack for Front/Backend/DB + Video/image hosting.
- [x] Git repo at spacesnapsg-nextjs

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 1:**
- [x] Confirmed auth strategy in writing (not "figure it out during Sprint 3")
- [x] Old Laravel repo tagged/branched as a rollback reference, left running if possible

---

## Sprint 1: Static Pages & Routing (Next.js + TS + Tailwind)

- [x] Set up file-based routing matching current nav structure (user/, supplier/, admin/)
- [x] Three role-specific layouts (UserLayout/teal, SupplierLayout/purple, AdminLayout/red) as Next.js layout.tsx files
- [x] Shared components ported to TS: Navbar, Button, Card, Input
- [x] Login/Signup pages
- [x] Discover/Marketplace page + Book Now modal
- [x] Digital Passport page + cert detail modal + training tutorials
- [x] Credit Wallet page + Top Up modal
- [x] User Dashboard
- [x] Notifications panel (reusable component, both navbars)
- [x] Supplier Inventory page + Add/Edit Listing modal
- [x] Supplier Tutorials page
- [x] Supplier Requests page
- [x] Supplier Profile page
- [x] Active nav-state highlighting
- [x] Responsive/visual polish pass
- [x] Admin Page Overview
- [x] Admin Page Users and Companies
- [x] Admin Page Financials
- [x] Admin Page Certificates and Training
- [x] Admin Approvals

**Verifications removed from this page (2026-07-18) — revisit before Sprint 3 wires the real endpoint.** Built it initially, then pulled it because its semantics are underspecified and I was guessing. What's actually known, from `CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md`:
- There's an `is_verified` boolean on `users`, explicitly documented as distinct from Laravel's `email_verified_at` — it means "System Admin reviewed and approved this user," not automatic email-ownership confirmation.
- Backend has `GET /admin/verifications/pending` and `PATCH /admin/verifications/{u}/approve` (`UserController@pendingVerifications` / `approveVerification`) — approve only, no reject endpoint exists.
- What's *not* documented anywhere (checked `Sprint_Plan.md` and the audit TODOs too): what puts a user into the pending-verification queue in the first place (auto on signup? triggered by some action? tied to an ID/doc upload that doesn't otherwise appear in the schema?), and what `is_verified` actually gates, if anything — unlike credential-gating (Sprint 4) there's no documented feature that checks this flag.
- The mock data I'd built in guessed a "user vs. supplier" distinction for pending verifications — that was invented for the UI shape, not backed by anything in the docs. Don't treat it as a real requirement if this gets rebuilt.

Bottom line: don't rebuild the Verifications tab until the trigger/effect of `is_verified` is nailed down — probably worth a quick grep of `spacesnap-api` (`UserController@pendingVerifications`) to see what actually populates that pending list, since the frontend-facing docs don't say.
Sign-out is still unwired in both UserNavbar.tsx and SupplierNavbar.tsx — same gap as the old app (buttons present, never call clearSession()).
Notifications page doesn't exist as a route, only the NotificationsPanel dropdown component — matches old app structure where /notifications was a page but this port hasn't built it yet. **The dropdown itself was mock-data-only (`MOCK_NOTIFICATIONS`) until 2026-07-21**, when it was wired to a real `Notification` model/backend as part of the BookingCredit feature — see CLAUDE1.md "BookingCredit Issuance — Rebook-or-Refund Flow." A dedicated `/notifications` page (vs. just the dropdown) is still not built.
The old app's known admin red/orange color never got tokenized (hardcoded arbitrary hex values). Worth a quick check that this rewrite's from-admin-red-start to-admin-orange-end classes are real theme tokens and didn't reintroduce that gap.



**Checklist before moving to Sprint 2:**
- [x] Every page renders with mock/static data, no console errors
- [x] TypeScript strict mode on, no `any` left in shared components
- [x] Visual diff against old Vite build — confirm no unintentional design drift

---

## Sprint 2: Database (Prisma + PostgreSQL)

- [x] Prisma schema: users, suppliers, spaces, credentials, training_records, bookings, transactions, certificates (with pending/approved/rejected states)
- [x] Exclusion constraint on `bookings` to prevent overlapping time slots (Prisma doesn't support this natively — needs raw SQL migration)
- [x] CHECK constraints for listing pricing rules (space/equipment vs. consumables)
- [x] Foreign keys across all tables
- [x] Seed script with test/mock data
- [x] Manual test: overlapping booking rejected at DB level (`23P01` exclusion violation confirmed via raw SQL insert)

**Amendment, 2026-07-20 — purchased/earned balance split:** the single combined wallet above (one balance, topped up via Stripe, deducted for any booking) creates MAS Payment Services Act exposure once that balance can settle a booking with a third-party operator — this product must never let a prepaid SGD float pay another member. Replaced with two independent, non-interchangeable balances computed live off the same `Transaction` ledger (never stored denormalized, same principle as before): `purchasedBalance` (bought with SGD, spendable only on SpaceSnap's own goods/services — consumables from SpaceSnap's own stock, certification fees, future gig-posting fees) and `earnedBalance` (never purchased, only issued as a reward, spendable as a booking discount, on consumables, or a gig-completion payout). A booking is now charged full price in real-time SGD via Stripe, with `earnedBalance` usable only as an optional discount line — `purchasedBalance` can never touch a booking, by design. Schema groundwork (extended `TransactionType`, `Booking.sgdAmount`/`earnedCreditsApplied`) landed in migration `20260720232512_credit_model_purchased_earned_split`; see the dated comments on `TransactionType` and `Booking` in `schema.prisma` for the full mechanics. The actual write-path rewiring (Stripe payment intent, earned-spend Transaction) is still open — see the Sprint 3.5 known-gaps rewrite below.

**Amendment, 2026-07-21 — consumables + gigs schema, and a standing constraint on earned credits:** extended the split above to the two other places earned credits apply, per the same "schema now, write-path later" discipline as the amendment above.
- **Inspection first (Task 1 of this session):** `Purchase`'s existing cost field is `credits` (not `cost`), confirmed by reading `prisma/schema.prisma` and `lib/purchases.ts` before touching anything. Gig tables/routes do not exist anywhere in this repo or the old Laravel codebase — confirmed by grep, not assumed.
- **Consumables:** `Purchase.earnedCreditsApplied` (Decimal, default 0) added — same discount-line pattern as `Booking.earnedCreditsApplied`. `credits` still covers the full purchase price via `purchasedBalance` unchanged; this is an additive discount option.
- **Gigs (new, minimal schema, no write-path):** `GigTask` (poster, description, `purchasedSpend`, `GigTaskStatus` open/assigned/completed/cancelled) and `GigAssignment` (gigTask, worker, `GigPayoutChoice` earned_credit/sgd, resolved `payoutAmount`, nullable `completedAt`). SpaceSnap is always principal — posting a task never pays another member directly. No `Transaction` FK column added to either gig model yet (unlike Booking/BulkOrderRequest/Purchase) — deliberately deferred to whichever future session actually builds the gig write path, not guessed at ahead of it.
- **`TransactionType` — inspected, not blindly extended:** before adding anything, checked whether the 5 values added in the previous amendment already covered gigs. They do: `purchased_spend`'s own comment already lists "gig-posting fees", and `earned_grant`/`earned_spend`'s comment already lists "gig-completion payouts" and "a gig worker's payout choice". So gig-posting spend maps to `purchased_spend`, and an `earned_credit` gig payout maps to `earned_grant` — both reuse existing values, disambiguated by which record the Transaction eventually points at once that FK is added. The one genuinely new case is a worker choosing **direct SGD** instead of earned credit: money leaving SpaceSnap to a member, which nothing existing represents. Added `TransactionType.gig_payout_sgd` for that case only, via migration `20260721010000_gigs_and_consumables_earned_credits`. (`earned_spend_booking`/`earned_spend_consumable`/`earned_grant_gig`/`gig_purchase_spend` were considered and deliberately **not** added — they would have duplicated the existing generic values above.)
- **Standing constraint (compliance-critical, not a style preference) — earned credits are never shown to a member as a dollar figure.** Always percentage-based, unit-based, or tied to a specific service ("10% off your next booking", "1 free consumables pack", "receive this gig payout as Earned Credits instead of SGD"), never "$10 off" or "$47 balance". This survives context resets: any future session touching earned-credit display must follow it. Enforced structurally today by: (1) `getEarnedBalance`/`getPurchasedBalance` (`lib/credits.ts`) carry an explicit comment warning against raw serialization, so the arithmetic helper exists without an obvious "just return it" endpoint next to it; (2) no API route currently returns a bare `earnedBalance` — `lib/earned-balance-guard.test.ts` statically scans every `app/api/**/route.ts` and fails the build if one ever does, registered in `npm test`. If a future endpoint needs to expose a member's earned-credit position, it must return a structured reward object (e.g. `{ type: "booking_discount_pct", value: 10 }`), never `{ balance: 47.00 }`.
- **Sprint 3.5/6 scope note:** gig write-path work (the `purchasedSpend` charge at posting, `payoutAmount` resolution and settlement at completion, the `Transaction`/`ActivityLog` rows, the `gig_payout_sgd` Stripe transfer) belongs in the same execution pass as the booking Stripe/earned-spend rewiring already tracked below — added explicitly to that scope so it isn't rediscovered piecemeal later.

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 3:**
- [x] Constraint tests written and passing, not just "assumed to work like Laravel version"
- [x] Schema reviewed against old Laravel schema for parity — nothing silently dropped

---

## Sprint 3: Backend API + Auth

- [x] Auth implementation per Sprint 0 decision (register/login/logout, User and Supplier roles)
- [x] Session/cookie handling verified across SSR and client boundaries (this is the highest-risk item in the whole rewrite — see note below) — mechanism confirmed correct in Session 2; the route-protection gap it surfaced is tracked as its own Sprint 4 item below, not a blocker on this line item
- [x] CRUD endpoints: spaces, credentials, bookings, certificates — credentials write access and bookings' credit ledger are intentionally partial, see Session 3/4 notes above and Sprint 3.5 below
- [x] Certificate request/approval flow: supplier submits request → system_admin approve/reject before entering pool (mirrors current backend routes)
- [x] System Admin scope: view all platform users with role, suspend/reinstate any user platform-wide
- [x] Connect all Sprint 1 pages to real endpoints (replace mock data) — done 2026-07-19: every page/component listed under Sprint 4.5 is now wired to a real route (marketplace/BookingModal/RequestPurchaseModal, passport, wallet/TopUpCreditsModal, user dashboard, supplier inventory/AddEditListingModal, supplier requests, supplier analytics/profile, admin users/companies, admin approvals, admin certificates & training). `npm test`, `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint .`, and `next build` all clean.
- [x] React Query wired for data fetching/caching — done alongside the above; every page above now uses a `lib/hooks/use*.ts` React Query hook (`useListings`, `useCredentials`, `useWallet`, `useCurrentUser`, `useCertificateCatalog`, `useSupplierListings`, `useSupplierBookings`, `useSupplierCertificates`, `useAdminUsers`, `useAdminCertificates`, `useUserBookings`), not just the login/signup mutations from before.

**Correction, same day:** the first pass of this item deleted `CreateSessionModal`, `ViewNamelistModal`, `QuizBuilderStep`, `UploadVideoModal`, `TrainingVideoModal`, `RatingDisplay`, and `RatingStars` (plus `lib/mock*.ts` files, including `mockTutorials.ts`) on the reasoning "no backend route exists yet." That's not a valid deletion reason on its own — the old Laravel API has working `TrainingVideoController`/`QuizQuestionController`/`TrainingSessionController` endpoints this stack just hasn't ported yet (a real, separately-tracked gap, not evidence the feature is unneeded). **Standing rule going forward: only delete a component when it's superseded by an equivalent replacement doing the same job (a mock file replaced by a real API call is normal cleanup) — never just because its backend doesn't exist yet in this stack.** All 5 training components + `mockTutorials.ts` were restored, left on mock data, each with a one-line TODO noting the specific old controller it's waiting on. The supplier Tutorials page and the admin Certificates & Training "Training Videos" tab are both back to their original mock-wired UI.

**Small backend additions made along the way** (same spirit as exposing an existing column, not new business logic): `serializeListing` now includes `companyName` (added a `company` include); `serializeCertificate` now includes `earningMethod` (column existed, was never returned); `serializeBooking` now includes `userTitle`; new `GET /api/wallet` (balance + transaction history — only `POST /topup` existed before), new `GET /api/me` (profile fields the JWT session doesn't carry), and new `GET /api/bookings` (the caller's own bookings — needed for the ratings feature below, closing the "no GET to list a user's own bookings" gap as a side effect). Also fixed a real bug found in the process: consumable listings were routed through `BookingModal`/`POST /api/bookings`, which 422s on consumables by design — both "Buy Now" and "Request Purchase" now correctly go through `RequestPurchaseModal`/`POST /api/bulk-order-requests`.

**New feature, same day — booking ratings:** unlike everything else in this sprint, this has no old-Laravel equivalent to port; it's new scope, requested and specced by the product owner directly (not from a design doc — this project has no rating/review spec on file). New `Rating` model/migration (`20260719144817_add_ratings`): one row per booking (`booking_id` unique — a user re-booking the same listing can rate each stay separately), `listing_id` denormalized off the booking for cheap aggregates, `score` 1-5 enforced by both app validation and a `ratings_score_range` DB CHECK constraint (matching this project's convention of enforcing domain rules at the DB level, not just app-layer), optional `comment`, not editable after submit (no PATCH route — resubmitting hits `RatingAlreadyExistsError`, a 422). `POST /api/bookings/[id]/rating` validates the booking belongs to the caller and is `completed` before accepting. `GET /api/listings` and `.../[id]` now return `averageRating`/`ratingCount` per listing (bulk `groupBy` aggregate, not one query per card). Frontend: the user dashboard's Recent Activity card lists real bookings and shows a `RatingStars` input for unrated completed ones (read-only star display, via a new `readOnly` prop on that component, once rated); the marketplace shows `RatingDisplay` (avg + count) on cards and the map detail panel, for space/equipment listings only — consumables can't be booked so can never be rated. Covered by `lib/ratings.test.ts` (7 tests: field validation, ownership/status/duplicate rejection, the DB CHECK constraint, and the aggregate query), registered in `npm test`.

**Backend gaps found and deliberately left unwired** (stubbed in the UI with a note, not built — flagged here per-item rather than guessed at):
- No `GET` to list active check-ins (only `POST` create + `PATCH` check-out exist) — user dashboard's "Currently Active" card.
- `activity_log` has no API route at all (write-only from server lib code) — same gap Sprint 4.5 already tracked; the user dashboard's "Recent Activity" card now shows real bookings instead (see the ratings feature above), not the generic activity_log feed.
- ~~No `GET /api/admin/companies` (nested supplier data)~~ — **closed 2026-07-20**, see CLAUDE1.md "Backend CRUD Pass — Admin Companies, Promotions, Revenue Aggregation, Business Details."
- ~~No admin-level booking-approval concept, and no `GET/PATCH /api/admin/promotions`~~ — promotions half **closed 2026-07-20** (same session as above); admin-level booking-approval explicitly **rejected by the product owner** (bookings stay supplier-owned, no admin override) — not a gap, a confirmed non-feature.
- ~~No admin-wide aggregation endpoint for total companies, cross-supplier bookings, or platform/per-operator revenue~~ — **closed 2026-07-20**, same session. Note: platform-total revenue can exceed the sum of the per-operator table when an orphaned pre-existing seed `Transaction` (no linked `Purchase`/`BulkOrderRequest`) can't be attributed to any company — see that session's write-up.
- ~~No route exposing `TrainingVideo` (list/create/edit/delete) or video-completion tracking~~ — **closed 2026-07-20**, see CLAUDE1.md "Video Tutorials — TrainingVideo/Quiz Backend + Supplier/Admin/User UI." `TrainingSession`s (already had routes as of the training-enrollments session) are unaffected by this note.
- No `Invoice`/`Receipt`/payout concept in the schema (Sprint 6's Stripe integration is unbuilt) — supplier profile's Accounts Receivable / Receipts & Invoices cards. **Still open** — genuinely blocked on Sprint 6, not touched.
- ~~No route exposing `Company` business fields... for editing~~ — **closed 2026-07-20**, see CLAUDE1.md "Backend CRUD Pass..." Scoped to businessName/businessDescription/registrationNumber (new column)/financeContactEmail (new column)/financeContactPerson (new column) only — businessLocation/yearsOperating deliberately excluded from the edit form per product owner call.

The Invoice/Receipt gap is the only one left in this list — a candidate for Sprint 6, not before.

**⚠️ Auth note:** Sanctum's SPA cookie auth is simple because it's pure client-side. NextAuth/JWT with SSR introduces CSRF and cookie-scope edge cases that don't exist in the old stack. Don't treat this as "same auth, different library" — budget explicit review time here.

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 3.5:**
- [x] Auth tested across: fresh login, session refresh, logout, expired session, concurrent tabs
- [ ] CORS/cookie behavior confirmed in a deployed (not just localhost) environment

## Sprint 3.5: Booking & Credit Money Flow — Built Correctly From Day 1

This is the sprint that didn't exist as its own thing in the original build — it was a bug-fix pass discovered late, via a dedicated data integrity audit. This time, build it right the first time as part of core CRUD, not as an afterthought.

**Known gaps to close (do not recreate these):**
- [x] Booking creation: check `credit_balance`, deduct credits, create a debit Transaction record, all wrapped in a single DB transaction with the Booking create — not two separate operations *(superseded 2026-07-20 by the purchased/earned balance split — see the new booking-creation item below; kept here, struck through in spirit not literally, so this line's history isn't lost)*
- [x] Booking confirm: creates a Transaction record (the original build never wired this — booking confirm silently deducted credits with no audit trail)
- [x] Booking decline: refund path creates a credit Transaction record correctly *(superseded 2026-07-20 — see the new decline item below)*
- [x] Bulk order: pricing field on bulk_order_requests (cost = credits_per_unit × quantity) — **corrected 2026-07-20**: the balance-check + Transaction pattern does *not* run at creation like a booking's does; per the product owner (matching the old Laravel app exactly), credits are checked and debited only at fulfillment. See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4.5 — Bulk Order Requests: Supplier UI + Backend." **Unaffected by the purchased/earned split** — bulk orders are SpaceSnap's own consumables stock, so this stays a `purchasedBalance` spend, unchanged.
- [x] `type: purchase` transactions actually created by app code, not only ever seeded for demos — closed by the bulk-order fulfillment debit (`fulfillBulkOrderWithDebit`, `lib/bulk-orders.ts`, corrected 2026-07-20 to fire at fulfillment rather than creation — see Sprint 4.5 note below) and by `createPurchaseWithDebit` ("Buy Now"); `type: topup` was the actual remaining gap (see wallet item below), not `purchase`, per the correction in CLAUDE1.md Known Gap #5. **Unaffected by the purchased/earned split**, same reasoning as bulk orders above — maps onto `purchased_spend` when this write path is eventually migrated to the new `TransactionType` values, no behavior change needed now.

**New known gaps, 2026-07-20 — purchased/earned balance split (schema landed, write paths not yet rewired):**
- [x] ~~Booking creation: replace the combined-wallet debit in `createBookingWithDebit` (`lib/bookings.ts`) with a Stripe payment intent for `Booking.sgdAmount` (full real-time SGD charge) and, if `earnedCreditsApplied > 0`, an `earned_spend` Transaction discounting the earned balance for that amount — both inside the same DB transaction as the Booking create, same atomicity discipline as today (a booking never exists without its matching charge/discount record, and vice versa). **`purchasedBalance` must never be deducted for a booking, under any code path** — this is the core rule the whole split exists to enforce, not a detail to optimize around.~~ — **closed 2026-07-21**, see CLAUDE1.md "Write-Path Session — Stripe Booking Charges + Purchase/RewardGrant Rewiring."
- [x] Booking decline: ~~still open~~ — **closed 2026-07-21, this line was stale** (caught in the same day's Cancel/Modify UI session): the "`declineBookingWithRefund` real rewrite" item under Sprint 6 closed it — real `stripe.refunds.create` sized by the cancellation-window tiers, plus proportional `earned_grant` reversal of any discount. See that Sprint 6 item and CLAUDE1.md "Cancellation Route + Commission-Rate Closure" for details.
- [ ] Booking confirm: **no change needed** — `confirmBookingWithAudit` already creates its own zero-amount audit Transaction, and that discipline (audit row, no ledger movement) is unaffected by where the money/discount actually moved at creation time.
- [x] ~~Consumables (2026-07-21, schema landed, write path not built): `Purchase.earnedCreditsApplied` needs the same discount-resolution wiring as the booking item above — a `purchased_spend`/Stripe charge for `credits - earnedCreditsApplied`, and if `earnedCreditsApplied > 0`, an `earned_spend` Transaction against that purchase, both inside `createPurchaseWithDebit`'s existing `$transaction`. `purchasedBalance` still covers the full `credits` amount when no discount is applied — unchanged path.~~ — **closed 2026-07-21**, same session as booking creation above. Resolved as purchasedBalance-funded (`purchased_spend`), not a Stripe charge — see that session's write-up for why the compliance boundary doesn't require Stripe here, unlike bookings.
- [ ] Gigs (2026-07-21, schema landed via `GigTask`/`GigAssignment`, no write path built — see the dated amendment above for the full schema/enum reasoning): posting a task charges the poster `purchasedSpend` (`purchased_spend` Transaction, or real-time SGD, poster's choice — same principal-in-the-middle pattern as every other SpaceSnap-as-seller flow); completing an assignment resolves `payoutAmount` and settles it via either `earned_grant` (worker chose earned credit) or the new `gig_payout_sgd` (worker chose direct SGD, actual Stripe transfer still unbuilt, tracked for audit trail only). Belongs in the same execution pass as the booking/consumables items above, not a separately rediscovered task. **Explicitly deferred again 2026-07-21** — gigs stay shelved per this session's own scoping instruction.

**New known gap, 2026-07-21 — RewardGrant issuance (schema + redemption landed, no issuance flow):** ~~both bookings and consumables purchases can now redeem a `RewardGrant` as a discount (`lib/reward-grants.ts`), but nothing in this codebase ever creates one~~ — **closed 2026-07-22**: redeeming a `discount`-category Rewards Catalogue item now mints a real `RewardGrant(booking_discount_pct)` with a 90-day expiry (`lib/reward-redemptions.ts`), the first real issuance path for a `RewardGrant`. Listed for the user via `GET /api/rewards/grants` and applied at checkout through `BookingModal`'s "Have a voucher?" dropdown. See CLAUDE1.md "Rewards Catalogue — Per-Category Fulfillment (2026-07-22)" and the Sprint 6.10 fulfillment items. (Referral flow and gig-completion payout remain separate, still-unbuilt issuance paths — but the "no issuance flow exists at all" blocker is gone.)

**New schema items (not fixes to the above — tables with no home in this plan until the parity audit):**
- [x] `check_ins` table (user_id, listing_id, booking_id nullable, checked_in_at, checked_out_at nullable) — the old app never had a working controller for this (table/model/factory existed, no route). This sprint should decide whether check-in updates booking status, previously unresolved/unconfirmed in the old codebase. **Decided (confirmed with product owner):** yes — check-in flips `confirmed`→`active`, check-out flips `active`→`completed`; see CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 3.5, New Schema Item — `check_ins` Table + Controller."
  - **Revisit later:** what happens if the user never checks in — a no-show? Nothing currently transitions a `confirmed` booking off that status if check-in never happens; it stays `confirmed` forever (or until decline). No detection, no timeout, no automatic cancel/forfeit. Undecided: does a no-show forfeit credits, get auto-declined/refunded after some grace window, or just sit stale? Not guessed at here — needs its own product decision before building, same as the check-in-updates-status question above.
- [x] `activity_log` table (user_id, action_type, description, related_listing_id nullable) — schema + write-path hooked into booking create/confirm/decline, bulk order, top-up, and check-in/out (see CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 3.5, New Schema Item — `activity_log` Table + Write-Path Hooks"). No feed UI yet.
- [x] `training_enrollments` table (user_id, training_session_id, status enum enrolled/awaiting_signoff/completed/cancelled, unique on the pair) — backs the training session "enrolled participants" list, a real feature not previously scoped into this rewrite plan. `POST /api/training-enrollments` (enroll) + `PATCH /api/training-enrollments/[id]` (supplier status update, `enrolled` unreachable as a target) — see CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 3.5, New Schema Item — `training_enrollments` Table + Enroll/Status-Update Endpoints."

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 4:**
- [x] Every credit-affecting action (book, confirm, decline, bulk order, top-up) has a corresponding Transaction record — re-verified end-to-end 2026-07-19 by performing each action live against the dev server/DB and querying `transactions` directly after each: booking create (debit row), confirm (zero-amount audit row), decline (refund row, balance restored exactly), bulk order (purchase row, cost = price_per_unit × quantity confirmed exact), top-up (topup row). All test rows deleted afterward, dev DB confirmed back to seeded state (`transactions`/`bookings` row counts unchanged). See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 3.5, End-to-End Re-Verification" for the full transcript.
- [x] `.env.testing` + isolated test DB set up from the start (the old build didn't have this until Sprint 3.5 — don't repeat that gap) — re-confirmed 2026-07-19 by snapshotting `spacesnap_dev` row counts, running `npm test` (60 tests, real DB writes/deletes), and confirming the dev DB counts were byte-identical before/after while the isolated `spacesnap_nextjs_test` DB is what the suite actually exercises. Not just set up once and abandoned — every Sprint 3.5 session's "Tests:" section (Known Gaps #1–5, check_ins, activity_log, training_enrollments) added cases to this same suite and it still runs clean.

---

## Sprint 4: Core Logic

- [x] Credential-gating: booking blocked without valid, non-expired credential — existence+expiry check was already built in Sprint 3 Session 4 (`missingCertificateIds`, `lib/bookings.ts`); this item re-verified it live against seeded data, no code changes needed. Schema has no `tier` concept at all (confirmed by grep) — out of scope here per item 2, not silently dropped
- [ ] Tier logic — **SCRAPPED, redesigned as certificate-set gating.** The original item 2 design (achieved tier per equipment class only increases; higher tier satisfies lower requirement) was built (`lib/tiers.ts`) on a wrong assumption. Confirmed with the product owner: there is no numeric tier progression — "tier" is just a label for *how* a certificate was earned (self-serve video/quiz vs. operator sign-off vs. operator-or-SME sign-off), not a level of achievement. Every path produces the same `user_certificates` row. `lib/tiers.ts`/`lib/tiers.test.ts` deleted; replaced by a plain set-difference module, `lib/certificate-gating.ts` (`getMissingCertificates`), wired into `missingCertificateIds` in `lib/bookings.ts`. See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4, Item 2 (revised)" session note for the full pivot writeup. Leaving this line unchecked because the *product-facing* tier concept (whatever UI/flow eventually surfaces `earning_method` to users) is still undefined — the gating mechanism itself is done and tested.
- [x] `certificates.earning_method` enum column added (`tier1_video_quiz` / `tier2a_operator_signoff` / `tier2b_operator_or_sme_signoff`), via a real migration (`prisma/migrations/20260719064218_add_certificate_earning_method`), kept distinct from the existing `certificates.category` column per the "don't conflate the two" note in CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md.
- [x] Booking validation: double-booking prevention enforced end-to-end — app-layer pre-check (`hasOverlappingBooking`, `lib/bookings.ts`) added ahead of the insert, plus the existing DB-constraint 23P01 catch now shares the identical clean message for the race window. See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4, Item 3" session note.
- [x] Training/credentialing flow: submit, review, pass/fail, issue credential — three earning paths, matching `CertificateEarningMethod`'s own labels (no unified "review" step exists across all three, by design): tier1_video_quiz is auto-graded (`lib/quiz-attempts.ts`, `POST /api/training-videos/[id]/quiz-attempts`, no reviewer); tier2b_operator_or_sme_signoff is a scheduled multi-participant session, reusing the existing `training_enrollments` status column (`completed` = pass, `cancelled` = fail — no new statuses added); tier2a_operator_signoff is an on-demand, per-user operator review (live demo request or uploaded recording evidence), a new `CertificateSignoffRequest` model (`lib/certificate-signoffs.ts`) — **corrected mid-sprint**: the first pass wrongly conflated tier2a with tier2b via `training_enrollments`, fixed after the product owner clarified they're different flows. All three paths issue credentials through a shared `lib/training-credentials.ts` helper. See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4, Item 4" and "Sprint 4, Item 4, Correction."
- [x] **Close the route-protection gap found in the Sprint 3 Session 2 session/cookie
      review (see `CLAUDE1.md`, "Sprint 3, Session 2" section, 2026-07-19):
      there is currently no server-side route protection anywhere** — no
      `middleware.ts`, no `auth()` call in any Server Component/layout, no
      `redirect()` guard. Confirmed live: with zero session cookie,
      `/admin/dashboard` and `/supplier` render their full pages to an
      anonymous request; only the navbar differs by route group, nothing
      actually checks the caller. Fix by adding `middleware.ts` (or
      per-layout `auth()` + `redirect()`) gating `(user)`, `(supplier)`, and
      `(admin)` route groups by the matching `isSupplier`/`isCompanyAdmin`/
      `isSystemAdmin` flag. This is the last item in Sprint 4 specifically so
      it closes right before Sprint 5's kiosk/middleware work builds on top
      of a trust boundary that actually holds. **Closed 2026-07-20**: this
      Next.js version renamed the `middleware.ts` convention to `proxy.ts`
      (confirmed via `node_modules/next/dist/docs` per this repo's own
      "read the docs first" rule in `AGENTS.md`) — added `proxy.ts` wrapping
      `auth()`, gating the three route groups by path prefix. See
      CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4, Route Protection" for the full write-up.

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 5:**
- [x] Certificate-set gating unit-tested with edge cases (holds all, missing one of several, holds none, expired treated as missing, no certs required) — 7 tests, `lib/certificate-gating.test.ts`, run via `npm test`. Supersedes the earlier "tier comparison logic" line item — see scrapped-tier note above.
- [x] Double-booking attempt produces a clean user-facing error, not a raw DB constraint error

## Sprint 4.5: Wire the Backend to the Frontend — Close the Mock-Data Gap

Found via a linkage audit (2026-07-19): every page still reads from `lib/mock*.ts`, and the gap is wider than the still-unchecked Sprint 3 item accounts for. That item assumes reconnecting pages that already exist; it doesn't cover Sprint 3.5 features that never had a page scoped for them in the first place, or the one new table with no route at all. Closing both together here instead of leaving them split across "Sprint 3 leftover" and "new scope no one wrote down."

- [ ] Connect all Sprint 1 pages to their real endpoints (completes the still-unchecked Sprint 3 item) — replace `lib/mock*.ts` usage in marketplace, passport, wallet, user dashboard, supplier inventory/requests/tutorials/profile, and all admin pages with live fetches against: `listings`, `bookings`, `supplier/bookings`, `supplier/listings`, `credentials`, `certificates`, `admin/certificates`, `admin/users`
- [ ] React Query actually adopted for these fetches (installed app-wide, currently only used for the login/signup mutations)
- [ ] **Deferred, not buildable yet** — Build UI for check-ins (check-in/check-out action). Per the kiosk handshake diagram and Trust Architecture doc the product owner provided 2026-07-20, a `CheckIn` is only ever supposed to be written by the physical kiosk's Pi after a local credential match + card dispense (Level 2 architecture: "Pi decides locally... dispense-confirmed atomic CheckIn written"). A browser "Check In" button would fabricate that event with no card, no physical-presence check, and no Pi involved — there's no legitimate basis for Next.js to write the row on a user's click. This is blocked on Sprint 5 (kiosk/middleware), not a UI gap to close from this repo. See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4.5 — Check-Ins UI Deferred, Not Built."
- [x] Build UI for training-enrollments — done 2026-07-20: the ask ("enroll button + supplier-side status update") undersold the gap — there was also no route to list sessions, list a session's participants, or create one, so the existing mock `CreateSessionModal`/`ViewNamelistModal` (supplier Tutorials page) and the passport page's stub card had nothing to wire to. Scoped up to the full loop with the product owner: new `GET /api/training-sessions` (public, merges the caller's own status), `GET`+`POST /api/supplier/training-sessions` (company-scoped, embeds the real namelist), plus a new `waitlisted` `TrainingEnrollmentStatus` — enrolling never rejects for being full, it waitlists, and only a supplier PATCH promotes waitlisted → enrolled. See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4.5 — Training Sessions: Enroll/Waitlist + Supplier Session Create/Namelist" for the full design and live-verification writeup.
- [x] Build UI for bulk-order-requests — done 2026-07-20: supplier-facing `GET /api/supplier/bulk-order-requests` + `PATCH .../confirm`/`.../decline`/`.../fulfill`, wired into the "Bulk Orders" tab on `/supplier-requests`. Corrected the Sprint 3.5 known-gap #4 design along the way — credits are debited only at fulfillment, not at request creation (matches the old Laravel app; an earlier session had this wrong). See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4.5 — Bulk Order Requests: Supplier UI + Backend."
- [x] Add an `activity_log` read endpoint (GET) — `GET /api/activity` (`lib/activity.ts`), the caller's own rows, optional `?types=` (CSV of `ActivityActionType` values) and `?days=` filters, `?limit=` capped at 200. Closes the gap noted since Sprint 3.5 ("no feed UI yet").
- [x] Decide + build an activity feed UI — the user dashboard's "Recent Activity" card now reads the real feed instead of just bookings: category filter pills (Bookings/Bulk Orders/Purchases/Wallet/Check-ins/Training/Certificates/All) and date-range pills (7d/30d/quarter/all, default 30d) so the list doesn't grow unbounded. Completed, unrated bookings still show the rating control inline. See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4.5 — Activity Log Read Endpoint + Recent Activity Feed UI."
- [x] **Credit hold on bulk-order confirmation** — closed 2026-07-20, same day as the deferral above (scoped with the product owner, then built same session). New `CreditHold` model (separate from `Transaction`; a reservation, not a ledger movement), `getAvailableCreditBalance` (live balance minus active holds, with lazy 7-day expiry on every read — no scheduled-job infra exists in this codebase). Confirm checks available balance and blocks with a warning (409, `requiresOverride`) unless the supplier explicitly overrides; an override still holds the order and writes a dedicated audit-trail activity-log row (`bulk_order_confirmed_despite_insufficient_credit`, logged under the buyer, matching every other bulk-order activity type and — unlike the supplier — the buyer actually has a UI that surfaces it). Hold releases on fulfill/decline-from-confirmed/cancellation-approved, plus lazy expiry. Wallet now shows available/held/total. See CLAUDE1.md "Credit Hold on Bulk-Order Confirmation" for the full write-up.
- [x] User-side bulk-order cancellation + supplier delivery estimate (product owner request, 2026-07-20) — see CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4.5 — Bulk Order Cancellation Flow + Delivery Estimate" for the full design and verification writeup. Summary: buyers can now see their own bulk order requests (new `GET /api/bulk-order-requests`) and cancel a still-`pending` one immediately (no supplier involvement, nothing was ever debited); once a request is `confirmed`, the buyer can only submit a cancellation request with a reason, which the supplier must approve or reject (new `cancellationRequestedAt`/`cancellationReason` fields, a warning-icon indicator on the supplier's request row, a review modal). Confirming a request now also requires the supplier to provide an estimated delivery date (new `estimatedDeliveryDate` field, required at confirm time).
- [x] Marketplace: give in-stock consumable listings a bulk-purchase option alongside "Buy Now" (product owner request, 2026-07-20, not a mock-data gap) — previously every consumable card/map-panel funneled into the same `RequestPurchaseModal` regardless of stock, just under different button text. **Corrected same day**: the product owner clarified "Buy Now" must not be a `BulkOrderRequest` at all — it's an immediate, completed sale (stock and credits move at creation, no supplier action pending), distinct from a bulk order request (which stays `pending` until the supplier fulfills it). Built a new `Purchase` model + `POST /api/purchases` (`lib/purchases.ts`, `createPurchaseWithDebit`) separate from the existing `BulkOrderRequest`/`POST /api/bulk-order-requests` path. "Buy Now" now calls the new endpoint (quantity locked at 1, atomic stock-decrement-and-debit); "Request Bulk Purchase" is unchanged, still the existing pending-approval quantity-picker flow. Stripe invoice/receipt (user invoice, supplier receipt of funds) is explicitly out of scope here — Sprint 6, not built, `stripePaymentIntentId` already exists on `Transaction` for when that lands. See CLAUDE1.md "Marketplace, Bulk Purchase Option for In-Stock Consumables" and its "Correction" follow-up.

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 5:**
- [x] Zero remaining `lib/mock*.ts` imports in page components — re-verified 2026-07-22: `lib/mockTutorials.ts` is still imported (supplier Tutorials page, `QuizBuilderStep`/`UploadVideoModal`/`TrainingVideoModal`/`AdminCertificatesTraining`), but only for its `QuizQuestion`/`VideoCategory` types and the `makeBlankQuizQuestion` helper — every one of those components is wired to the real `useCreateTrainingVideo`/`useSaveTrainingVideoQuiz`/`useAdminTrainingVideos` hooks, not mock data. Found and fixed one stale artifact of this in the process: `QuizBuilderStep.tsx` still carried a `// TODO: still on mock data... waiting on this stack's port of the old QuizQuestionController` comment left over from before Sprint 4.5's quiz backend landed (closed 2026-07-20) — removed, no behavior change.
- [x] Every Sprint 3.5 endpoint (check-ins, training-enrollments, bulk-order-requests, wallet top-up, certificates + admin/supplier certificate routes) has at least one real frontend caller, or is explicitly marked deferred with a reason — re-verified 2026-07-22 by grep: check-ins (user dashboard), training-enrollments (`TrainingSessionDetailModal`, `useTrainingSessions`/`useSupplierTrainingSessions`), bulk-order-requests (`RequestPurchaseModal`, `useMyBulkOrders`/`useSupplierBulkOrders`), wallet top-up (`TopUpCreditsModal`), certificates (passport, `AddEditListingModal`, `CreateSessionModal`, `CertificateDetailModal`) and admin/supplier certificate routes (`AdminCertificatesTraining`, `AdminApprovals`, `useAdminCertificates`/`useSupplierCertificates`) all confirmed wired.

## Sprint 4.75: UI Findings From the Money-Flow Rewiring (2026-07-21)

Surfaced while auditing the Sprint 3.5/6 write-path changes (purchased/earned
split, Stripe direct-charge bookings, cancellation-model schema) against the
actual frontend — a mix of one real stale-copy bug and several UI gaps that
are net-new features with no backend to wire to yet. Listed together here so
they aren't lost across the Sprint 4.5/6/6.5 boundaries they each individually
belong to.

- [x] **Stale copy, fixable now, no backend dependency:** closed 2026-07-21 —
  [`app/(supplier)/supplier-profile/page.tsx`](<app/(supplier)/supplier-profile/page.tsx>)'s
  "No rating system built yet" replaced with a real weighted average across
  the supplier's own listings (or "No ratings yet" when none exist). Found a
  real bug underneath the stale copy while wiring it: `GET
  /api/supplier/listings` never passed a `ratingAggregate` to
  `serializeListing` at all (unlike the public `/api/listings` routes), so
  every supplier-facing listing always serialized `averageRating: null` —
  fixed by wiring `getListingRatingAggregates` into that route the same way
  the public routes already do it. Verified live (`ben@acmecoworking.sg`,
  real cookie-jar login): card now reads "No ratings yet" against the seeded
  dev DB, which has no ratings yet — not just eyeballed from the code.
- [x] **Stripe Elements real card-entry UI — built 2026-07-21, one
  verification step pending.** `components/StripeCardField.tsx` (Elements
  provider + themed CardElement + `useCreateCardPaymentMethod`); the card goes
  straight from Stripe's iframe to Stripe and only the resulting `pm_...` id
  reaches the existing routes — no server changes. `BookingModal.tsx`'s
  hardcoded `pm_card_visa` is gone; the Modify Booking modal's fee tier uses
  the same field. Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (added to
  `.env.example`); without it the modals render a clear "not configured"
  notice with the confirm button disabled (verified live) instead of a broken
  iframe. **Charging a real test card through the new field is the one
  unverified step** — no publishable key existed in this dev environment as
  of 2026-07-21 (deliberately skipped that session, product owner's call);
  everything up to Stripe's iframe boundary is verified. **Publishable key
  added 2026-07-21** (later the same day, product owner provided it) —
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` now set in `.env`. Still need to
  actually run one booking with card `4242 4242 4242 4242` through the live
  UI before calling this fully closed — queued as the next task after the
  Stripe webhook work below.
- [x] **Cancel Booking UI — built 2026-07-21** (the Sprint 6 cancellation
  route it was blocked on closed earlier the same day). Entry point: a new
  "My Bookings" card on the user dashboard (`app/(user)/user/page.tsx`),
  mirroring the existing Bulk Orders card — rows for every booking, with
  Cancel/Modify actions on `pending`/`confirmed` ones only.
  `CancelBookingModal` previews the refund by running the SAME calculators
  the server executes (`lib/booking-policy.ts` — day tier through
  `applyRefundCap`), optional reason, then `PATCH /api/bookings/[id]/cancel`.
  Verified live against the dev server: a 1-day-out booking previewed and
  executed 0% (no refund Transaction written, reason persisted), a 5-day-out
  booking previewed 50%/S$12.50 and the executed Stripe refund matched
  exactly (real refund id on the ledger row). See CLAUDE1.md
  "Sprint 4.75 — Cancel/Modify Booking UI + Stripe Elements" session note.
- [x] **`Company.supplierTier` admin UI — closed 2026-07-21**, same session as
  the Sprint 6 admin route it was blocked on. Per-company tier `<select>` on
  the admin Companies tab (`components/AdminUsersCompanies.tsx`). See the
  Sprint 6 item above for the full write-up.
- [x] **`BookingCredit` issuance + redemption UI — closed 2026-07-21.** Full
  rebook-or-refund flow, built per the product owner's specific UX brief
  (browse-alternatives-first funnel, refund buried as the last card, not an
  upfront choice; no "S$"/SGD anywhere in the app, credits-only display).
  See CLAUDE1.md "BookingCredit Issuance — Rebook-or-Refund Flow" for the
  full design and live-verification writeup.
- [x] **Rewards/tier UI (Free/Starter/Growth/Power) — closed 2026-07-22, this
  line was stale.** Was blocked on Sprint 6.5's thresholds/spend-window/
  referral-bonus numbers being confirmed; Sprint 6.5 closed the same day and
  built exactly this — the user dashboard's "User Tier" card wired to real
  `GET /api/me` data plus its `TierBenefitsModal` infographic (see Sprint 6.5
  above). This checkbox was never ticked when that line closed; re-verified
  2026-07-22 by grep that both are real and wired, not left as a stub.
- [x] **Modify Booking (reschedule) — backend, closed 2026-07-21.** New
  feature, added as a Sprint 4.75 item per the product owner's own pseudocode
  spec (Modification Request Engine + Cancellation Refund Cap Engine). `PATCH
  /api/bookings/[id]/modify` (`modifyBookingWithFee`, `lib/bookings.ts`) lets
  the booking's own user reschedule its `startDate` (duration preserved):
  more than 7 days' notice is free and resets `maxRefundablePercent` to 100;
  3-7 days' notice charges a real 20% Stripe fee (of `sgdAmount`) and sets
  `isModified = true` + `maxRefundablePercent = 50`; under 3 days' notice is
  rejected outright. `Booking.maxRefundablePercent` now caps
  `cancelBookingWithRefund`'s day-tier refund via a new `applyRefundCap`
  helper (`lib/booking-payments.ts`) — a never-modified booking is
  unaffected (cap is `null`, a no-op). See CLAUDE1.md "Sprint 4.75 — Modify
  Booking (Reschedule) Backend" for the full design, flagged assumptions
  (what "booking_fee" means, duration-preserving reschedule, why the cap
  only applies to user-initiated cancellation and not supplier decline), and
  live-verification transcript. **Frontend UI built 2026-07-21** (follow-up
  session, same day): `ModifyBookingModal` on the dashboard's new My Bookings
  card, next to Cancel — shared date picker extracted from `BookingModal`
  into `components/BookingDatePicker.tsx`, fee/eligibility preview via the
  same `calculateModificationTerms` the server runs, card entry (Stripe
  Elements) required exactly when the 3-7-day fee tier applies. Free-tier
  reschedule verified live end-to-end (dates moved, `originalStartDate`
  preserved and surfaced as "Rescheduled from …", cap reset to 100, no fee
  row); fee-tier UI verified up to the card field (real charge pending the
  publishable key, per the Stripe Elements item above).

## Sprint 5: Kiosk/Middleware API

- [ ] Separate API surface for kiosk hardware auth
- [ ] Coordinate scope with the funded POC middleware work — this API surface must stay consistent with the Trust Architecture principle (Pi decides locally; this API only ever supplies credential facts, never an authorization verdict)

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 6:**
- [ ] Confirmed with middleware spec (v1.3) that no endpoint here could be mistaken for or misused as an authorization decision endpoint

---

## Sprint 6: Payments

**Amended 2026-07-20 (purchased/earned balance split — see Sprint 2 amendment above):** a real-time Stripe charge per booking is the primary payment path in this product, not an optional add-on to a wallet. Every booking is charged full price in SGD via a Stripe payment intent for `Booking.sgdAmount` at creation time; no wallet balance is ever deducted to pay for a booking. `earnedBalance` may only reduce that charge as a discount line (`Booking.earnedCreditsApplied`, recorded as an `earned_spend` Transaction) — it never replaces the Stripe charge outright. `purchasedBalance` (wallet top-ups) is not a booking payment method at all; it only pays for SpaceSnap's own goods/services (consumables, certification fees, future gig-posting fees) — this is the regulatory boundary the whole split exists to enforce, so no future feature should route `purchasedBalance` into a booking, whatever wallet UI Sprint 7 or later ends up presenting.

- [ ] Stripe integration: booking payment intents (`Booking.sgdAmount`, real-time SGD charge per booking) are the core of this sprint, not user-to-supplier wallet payments — see the amendment note above. Platform fee / operator payout mechanics still apply on top of the per-booking charge, scope TBD when this sprint starts. **Correction, 2026-07-21:** the direct-charge PaymentIntent path itself is no longer "not yet built" — `createBookingWithDebit` (`lib/bookings.ts`) already charges Stripe directly per booking (see CLAUDE1.md "Write-Path Session — Stripe Booking Charges..."). Leaving this line unchecked because the rest of this item (webhooks, decline→refund, platform-fee/payout mechanics) is still open, not because the charge-on-create piece is undone.

**Re-audited 2026-07-21 (closing a standing "confirm this is merchant-of-record, not Connect" item carried in an out-of-repo status note):** re-checked `lib/bookings.ts:280-294` directly — `stripe.paymentIntents.create()` with no `transfer_data`, `application_fee_amount`, or connected-account (`stripeAccount`) parameters anywhere in `lib/bookings.ts`/`lib/stripe.ts`. This is a plain charge into SpaceSnap's own Stripe balance, genuinely merchant-of-record, not a Connect split. Already committed (`1a7ff5d`, `53e78f6`) — nothing was uncommitted. No code changes were needed; this line stays unchecked only for the still-open webhook/decline-refund/payout-mechanics items below.
- [ ] ⚠️ Developer review required before going live — financial/compliance risk, same flag as the original plan
- [x] **Cancellation-window policy + supplier payouts, schema only (2026-07-21)** — `Booking` gained `cancelledAt`/`cancelledBy`/`cancellationReason`/`userRefundPercent`/`supplierPenaltyPercent`; new `BookingCredit` (bounded, per-booking credit note — not a wallet top-up) and `SupplierPayable` (what SpaceSnap owes a supplier per booking under the merchant-of-record model) models; `Company.supplierTier` (free/preferred/top, admin-settable only, no auto-gating logic). Pure calculators `calculateUserCancellationRefund`/`calculateSupplierCancellationPenalty` (`lib/booking-payments.ts`) resolve the day-based percent tiers. **The exact cancellation-window day thresholds (7/3/0) and their refund/penalty percentages (100/50/0) are this session's own assumption, inferred from the task brief's boundary-day test cases — not confirmed with the product owner.** Confirm before wiring this into a real cancellation route. See CLAUDE1.md "Schema + Core Lib — Merchant-of-Record Cancellation Model" for the full write-up, including what was already partially built before this session started.

  **Follow-on items, not yet done (broken out 2026-07-21 so each is separately trackable instead of buried in one paragraph):**
  - [x] **Commission-rate field — closed 2026-07-21.** Confirmed with the product owner: flat 10% for space/equipment bookings (7% applies elsewhere — consumables/bulk orders — out of scope here). `Booking.platformCommissionPercent` (Decimal 5,2, default 10.00) snapshotted at creation time in `createBookingWithDebit`, not read live at cancellation time, so a future rate change can't reshuffle an already-created booking's numbers — same principle as `SupplierPayable.invoicingCadence`. See CLAUDE1.md "Cancellation Route + Commission-Rate Closure" for the full write-up.
  - [x] **`Company.supplierTier` admin route — closed 2026-07-21.** `PATCH /api/admin/companies/[id]/supplier-tier` (`app/api/admin/companies/[id]/supplier-tier/route.ts`), system-admin-only, validates against the `SupplierTier` enum (422 on an invalid value), no automatic gating logic (matches the field's own schema comment — manual admin decision only). `serializeAdminCompany` now returns `supplierTier`; new `useSetSupplierTier` hook; `AdminUsersCompanies.tsx`'s Companies tab gained a per-row tier `<select>` (pulled out of the existing expand-toggle `<button>` to avoid nesting an interactive element inside one, confirmed row-expand still works independently). Verified live via real cookie-jar login as `alice.admin@spacesnap.sg`: GreenPack Supplies free→top, confirmed via direct network response and a hard page reload (persisted, not just optimistic UI); invalid tier value → clean 422; reset back to `free` afterward, DB back to seeded state. `npm test` 244/244, `npx tsc --noEmit`/`eslint .` clean on touched files, `next build` clean with the new route listed.
  - [x] **Cancellation route + real Stripe refund execution — closed 2026-07-21.** `PATCH /api/bookings/[id]/cancel` (`cancelBookingWithRefund`, `lib/bookings.ts`), scoped to the booking's own user (not the supplier — that's still `declineBookingWithRefund`/the existing decline route). **This also required a correction to the already-shipped `declineBookingWithRefund`, confirmed with the product owner**: whichever party did NOT cause the cancellation is made whole, so the day-based tier only ever applies to the at-fault party's own side — it does not apply to both simultaneously the way the original (unconfirmed) design did.
    - Supplier-initiated (decline): user now always refunded 100% (previously wrongly tiered by day-before-start). The day tier instead sizes the supplier's penalty against `Booking.platformCommissionPercent` of `sgdAmount`.
    - User-initiated (cancel, new): user's refund follows the day tier as originally designed; supplier is unaffected (a cancelled booking never earned anything either way).
    - `SupplierPayable.invoicingCadence` mapping from `Company.supplierTier`, also confirmed with the product owner: `free`→monthly, `preferred`→biweekly, `top`→weekly (`invoicingCadenceForSupplierTier`, `lib/booking-payments.ts`).
    - See CLAUDE1.md "Cancellation Route + Commission-Rate Closure" for the full write-up, live-verification transcript, and test coverage.
  - [x] **`SupplierPayable` correction: completion earnings + live aggregate balance — closed 2026-07-21 (same day, separate session).** The line above initially wrote a `SupplierPayable` for the *cancelled* booking itself with a fabricated `grossAmount` — wrong, since a cancelled booking's money was refunded, not earned. Caught by the product owner's own worked example (2× $5 completed bookings + 1× $5 booking declined <3 days out → supplier should net $8.50, SpaceSnap $1.50). Fixed: new `createCompletedBookingPayable` (`lib/supplier-payables.ts`) writes the real earning row when a booking actually completes (wired into `checkOutCheckIn`, `lib/check-ins.ts` — this row never existed anywhere before this fix). `declineBookingWithRefund`'s row is now a pure penalty debit (`grossAmount 0`); `cancelBookingWithRefund`'s is now a zero-effect audit row (all three amounts 0), not a fabricated payout. New `getSupplierPendingPayableBalance(companyId)` — live `SUM(netAmount)` over a company's pending rows, same never-denormalized principle as `getCreditBalance` — is what actually nets a penalty against other bookings' earnings; no explicit "check balance, then deduct" step exists or is needed anywhere. See CLAUDE1.md "SupplierPayable Correction — Completion Earnings + Live Aggregate Balance" for the full write-up, including the live verification reproducing the exact worked example through the real API routes.
  - [x] **`BookingCredit` issuance — closed 2026-07-21.** Full rebook-or-refund flow built (issuance, redemption, forced-refund cron, admin goodwill grants) — see the Sprint 4.75 line above and CLAUDE1.md "BookingCredit Issuance — Rebook-or-Refund Flow" for the full design. `declineBookingWithRefund` renamed to `declineBookingPendingResolution` as part of this — it no longer fires an immediate Stripe refund, it issues the credit and defers the refund to the user's own choice.
  - [x] **`declineBookingWithRefund` real rewrite** — closed 2026-07-21. Replaced the flat combined-ledger `refund` Transaction with a real `stripe.refunds.create` against the original PaymentIntent, sized by `calculateUserCancellationRefund`/`calculateSupplierCancellationPenalty` (the cancellation-window percent tiers from the schema session above), plus a proportional `earned_grant` reversal of any `earnedCreditsApplied` discount (ledger-only — the `RewardGrant` row stays `redeemed`, since its job was authorizing the original discount, not tracking the live balance). `cancelledAt`/`cancelledBy`/`cancellationReason`/`userRefundPercent`/`supplierPenaltyPercent` are now written on the `Booking` row. Deliberately still does **not** write a `SupplierPayable` (blocked on the commission-rate gap below) or issue a `BookingCredit` (issuance policy still undecided) — both flagged in the function's own header comment, not guessed at. 4 new tests added to `lib/bookings.test.ts` (100%/50%/0% refund tiers, proportional earned-credit reversal) alongside the 4 existing decline tests, all passing against the real dev DB + Stripe test-mode sandbox (`npm test`: 213/213). `npx tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, and `next build` all clean.
  - [x] Which `InvoicingCadence` each `SupplierTier` maps to — ~~undecided~~ **this line was stale** (caught 2026-07-21): confirmed with the product owner and built the same day as the cancellation route — `free`→monthly, `preferred`→biweekly, `top`→weekly (`invoicingCadenceForSupplierTier`, `lib/booking-payments.ts`), per the item a few lines above.

**Checklist before moving to Sprint 7:**
- [x] Stripe webhook tested in sandbox for all states: success, failure, refund — closed 2026-07-21, `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` + `lib/stripe-webhooks.ts`. See CLAUDE1.md "Stripe Webhooks" for the full write-up, including why this endpoint is a reconciliation/observability safety net rather than the primary write path (every Stripe-charging route already records its own Transaction synchronously).
- [ ] No live payment code merged without a second reviewer

## Sprint 6.5: Rewards/Tier System (Free/Starter/Growth/Power) — Closed 2026-07-22

Numbers confirmed with the product owner 2026-07-21/22 (chat, not a design
doc), then built the same session. Distinct from the already-scrapped
equipment-certification "tier" concept (`lib/tiers.ts`, deleted in Sprint 4
Item 2 — see that section's writeup above): this is a *user reward* tier
(Free/Starter/Growth/Power), unrelated to how a certificate was earned. Also
distinct from `Company.supplierTier` (Sprint 6, supplier-side payment tiers)
— three separate tier concepts in this product now, don't conflate them.

- [x] Reward-tier model, confirmed: rolling 3-month window, BOTH a bookings-
  count AND a spend threshold required per tier (Free 1% rebate/no threshold,
  Starter ≥8 bookings & ≥$1,000 SGD spend/1.2%, Growth ≥20 & ≥$2,500/1.5%,
  Power ≥35 & ≥$4,500/1.8%). Never stored denormalized — computed live off
  completed bookings + `ReferralSpendBonus` rows, same "live SUM" principle
  as every other balance in this codebase. See `lib/reward-tiers.ts`.
- [x] Rebate mechanic: % snapshotted onto `Booking.rewardTierRebatePercent`
  at booking CREATION (the tier held when the user booked, not a later
  change), paid out as an `earned_grant` Transaction at booking COMPLETION
  (check-out) — reuses the existing `earned_grant` TransactionType value, no
  new enum needed.
- [x] Referral mechanic: every user gets a `referralCode` (captured
  optionally at signup via `referredByUserId`). When a referred user's own
  booking of ≥$300 SGD completes (first qualifying booking only — a referral
  converts once), the referrer gets a real $20 SGD `earned_grant` plus a
  $200 SGD bump to their own rolling-window spend figure (`ReferralSpendBonus`
  — a phantom, non-ledger row, never a `Transaction`, same idiom as
  `BookingCredit`/`CreditHold`).
- [x] `RewardGrant` (Sprint 6) — confirmed unaffected/not reused: that's the
  discount-redemption mechanic for a *specific* grant type
  (`booking_discount_pct` etc.); the reward-tier rebate is unconditional
  earned-credit issuance on every completed booking, a different shape, so
  it goes straight to a Transaction, not through `RewardGrant`.

New/changed files: `lib/reward-tiers.ts` (tier table + pure
`computeUserRewardTier`/`rebatePercentForTier`, `getUserRewardTierWindowStats`/
`getUserRewardTier`, `grantRewardTierRebate`, `maybeConvertReferral`);
`Booking.rewardTierRebatePercent`/`completedAt`, `User.referralCode`/
`referredByUserId`/`referralConvertedAt`, new `ReferralSpendBonus` model,
two new `ActivityActionType` values (migration
`20260721140000_reward_tiers_referrals`); wired into `createBookingWithDebit`
(`lib/bookings.ts`) and `checkOutCheckIn` (`lib/check-ins.ts`);
`app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (referral code generation/capture);
`GET /api/me` (structured `rewardTier`/`referralCode`, never a bare balance —
same compliance framing `lib/earned-balance-guard.test.ts` enforces);
signup page referral field; the user dashboard's pre-existing "User Tier"
card (previously hardcoded placeholder, now wired to real data) and its
`TierBenefitsModal` infographic (unchanged asset, just its own stale comment
fixed).

**Flagged assumptions (this session's own inferences, not explicitly asked —
confirm before treating as permanent policy, same posture as every other
"flag rather than silently guess" item in this file):** both bookings-count
and spend are counted from COMPLETED bookings only; referral qualification
checks a booking's headline `sgdAmount`, not the post-discount Stripe charge;
a referral converts at most once, not once per qualifying booking.

**Tests:** `lib/reward-tiers.test.ts` — pure tier-boundary unit tests plus
real-DB integration tests (rolling-window inclusion/exclusion, creation-time
snapshot correctness including a seeded Starter-tier user, full referral
conversion + no-double-grant). All 287 tests in `npm test` pass. `npx tsc
--noEmit`, `eslint .`, and `next build` all clean.

**Verified live**, not just unit-tested — real cookie-jar logins against the
dev server/DB (`ethan@example.com`, a fresh referral-code signup, real
Stripe test-sandbox charges): completed a $120 booking as a free-tier user →
exactly one `earned_grant` Transaction for 1.20 SGD (1%); registered a new
user with Ethan's referral code, completed a $400 booking as that user →
Ethan received a $20 `earned_grant` tied to that booking, a `ReferralSpendBonus`
row of $200, and the referee's `referralConvertedAt` was set; confirmed via
`GET /api/me` that Ethan's live stats reflected the $320 combined spend and
the correct bottlenecked progress percentage. All test bookings/transactions/
activity-log rows/the test user deleted afterward; dev DB confirmed back to
seeded state (Ethan's tier back to free/0).

## Sprint 6.6: Rewards Catalogue UI (Financials Page) — placeholder catalogue, 2026-07-22

Distinct from Sprint 6.5's reward-*tier* rebate system above (the 1%/1.2%/1.5%/1.8%
earned-credit rebate) — this is the redemption *catalogue* surfaced on the
user Financials page (`app/(user)/wallet/page.tsx`), letting a user see what
their `earnedBalance` can actually be spent on beyond a plain booking-discount
percentage.

- [x] Financials page, Earned Credits card: replaced the static "Earned by
  completing bookings & rewards" line with a clickable "Check out your
  redeemable rewards!" button.
- [x] `components/RewardsCatalogueModal.tsx` — Teal → Purple themed modal:
  header banner showing the user's real `earned` credit balance (from
  `useWallet`), a "View redeemed rewards" toggle that drops down
  active/unused vouchers or tickets, and a grid-card rewards catalogue below
  (image/icon tile, header, description per card).
- [x] **Catalogue rewards were placeholder only at the time this line was
  written — closed across Sprint 6.7/6.9/6.10, stale checkbox fixed
  2026-07-23.** All 7 reward types now back to a real `RewardCatalogueItem`
  schema (Sprint 6.7), full admin add/edit/delete (Sprint 6.9), and a real
  per-category redemption/fulfillment flow — `discount`/`consumable`/
  `tier_upgrade` resolve immediately, `pitch_ticket`/`consultancy` go through
  an admin concierge queue (Sprint 6.10 fulfillment). The "View redeemed
  rewards" dropdown reads real `RewardRedemption` rows via
  `GET /api/rewards/redemptions`, not placeholder data — see the Sprint 6.9
  "Real redemption/issuance flow" item below for where that closed.

---

## Sprint 6.7: Admin UI — Activate/Deactivate Rewards Catalogue Items — Closed 2026-07-22

- [x] New nav slot: `AdminNavbar.tsx`'s "Companies" link (redundant — both
  `/admin-users` and `/admin-companies` already rendered the same
  `AdminUsersCompanies` component with its own internal Users/Companies tab
  switcher, confirmed with the user before changing) was replaced with a
  **Rewards** link (`/admin-rewards`, `Gift` icon), and "Users" renamed to
  **"Users & Coys"**. `AdminUsersCompanies.tsx` itself is untouched — the
  Companies tab is still reachable from Users & Coys, just no longer a
  top-level nav item.
- [x] Real schema home for "reward catalogue item": new `RewardCatalogueItem`
  model + `RewardCatalogueCategory`/`RewardDiscountAppliesTo` enums
  (migration `20260722041412_reward_catalogue_items`), distinct from
  `RewardGrant` (an issued/redeemed grant, not a catalogue definition) per
  this item's own original note. Seeded with the original 7 items from
  Sprint 6.6's hardcoded `CATALOGUE_REWARDS` array.
- [x] Admin UI: `components/AdminRewards.tsx` (`/admin-rewards`) —
  activate/deactivate toggle per item, plus (see Sprint 6.9 below) full
  add/edit/delete.
- [x] Wired for real: `GET /api/rewards` (active items only) replaces
  `RewardsCatalogueModal.tsx`'s hardcoded array; verified live an
  admin-deactivated item stops rendering for a real user
  (`ethan@example.com`) without a page reload lag.
- [x] **Closed 2026-07-22, stale checkbox fixed 2026-07-23** — the "View
  redeemed rewards" active-vouchers list was still placeholder
  (`PLACEHOLDER_ACTIVE_VOUCHERS`) when this line was written, but is real
  now: `GET /api/rewards/redemptions` (the caller's own `RewardRedemption`
  rows) was added as part of Sprint 6.9's "Real redemption/issuance flow"
  item, and `RewardsCatalogueModal.tsx` reads it directly.

---

## Sprint 6.8: Admin UI — Customize Reward Values — Closed 2026-07-22, broader scope than originally written

**Scope correction, confirmed directly with the user before building:** this
item's original wording ("set the Discount Voucher's `%`", "set the
Consumable Redemption's value") undersold what was actually needed. Each of
the 7 reward types has its own genuinely different customizable fields, not
just two numeric values — see `RewardCatalogueItem`'s schema comment
(Sprint 6.7 above) for the full field list per category (discount `%` +
applies-to; pitch-ticket/consultancy partner + subject; event name/info;
lucky-draw prize + quantity; tier-upgrade duration in months; consumable
name + quantity). The base `description` shown on each card is also
admin-editable, confirmed with the user. All of this ships in the same
`AdminRewards.tsx`/`RewardItemModal` built for Sprint 6.7 — one edit modal
whose fields render conditionally per the item's `category`.

- [x] Admin UI to set the Discount Voucher's `%` (plus which categories it
  applies to — Booking/Equipment/Certification Fee, multi-select).
- [x] Admin UI to set the Consumable Redemption's name + quantity (not just
  a bare "value").
- [x] Every other reward type's own fields (see above) are editable too, per
  the corrected scope.
- [x] All values are per-catalogue-item, not global constants — confirmed
  via `PATCH /api/admin/rewards/[id]`, which only accepts the fields valid
  for that item's own category (`lib/reward-catalogue.ts`'s per-category
  allow-list) — sending a field that doesn't belong to the category is a
  clean 422, verified live (e.g. `prizeQuantity` on a `discount` item).

---

## Sprint 6.9: Admin UI — Add/Delete Rewards Catalogue Items — Closed 2026-07-22 (added mid-session per user request)

Not in the original plan — added when the user asked for full add/delete
capability on top of the Sprint 6.7/6.8 customization work, rather than a
fixed set of 7 catalogue items. Changed the schema approach: no fixed
`RewardCatalogueItemKey` enum tied to exactly 7 rows — identity is just the
row's `id`, `category` determines which fields apply, and there is no limit
on how many items can exist per category.

- [x] `POST /api/admin/rewards` — create a new catalogue item (any category,
  admin-chosen name/description + that category's fields).
- [x] `DELETE /api/admin/rewards/[id]` — hard delete (no other table
  references `RewardCatalogueItem`, confirmed against the schema, so no
  cascade concerns).
- [x] `AdminRewards.tsx`: "Add Reward" button opens the same modal used for
  editing (category picker + conditional fields), plus a delete-confirm
  modal mirroring `AdminCertificatesTraining.tsx`'s existing
  `DeleteVideoModal` pattern.
- [x] Icon lookup in `RewardsCatalogueModal.tsx` keys off **category** (7
  fixed icons), not a fixed per-item id, so a newly-admin-added item
  automatically gets a sensible icon.

**Bug caught and fixed during live verification, not just unit-tested:**
`RewardItemModal`'s form state was initialized from `useState(initialItem ?
formValuesFromItem(initialItem) : EMPTY_FORM)` — since the modal component
is mounted once and reused across every add/edit rather than remounted per
item, that initializer only ever ran on the very first mount, so opening
"Edit" on a second item showed the *first* item's (or a blank) form, not the
clicked item's own data. Fixed with the same "adjust state during render
when a prop changes" `resetKey` pattern this codebase already uses in
`TrainingVideoModal.tsx` (keyed off `open` + the item's id). Verified live
after the fix: editing "Legal Consultancy" after having just edited/added
other items now correctly loads its own Subject/Partner values every time.

**Verified live end-to-end** (real cookie-jar login as
`alice.admin@spacesnap.sg`, dev server/DB): created a new `consumable`-
category "Coffee Voucher" item, confirmed it rendered correctly (icon,
description, "Coffee × 2") in `RewardsCatalogueModal` for `ethan@example.com`
alongside the other 7, then deleted it — gone from both the admin list and
the modal. Toggled Discount Voucher inactive → confirmed it disappeared
from the modal → reactivated. Edited Legal Consultancy's partner name,
confirmed it persisted, then reverted it back to the seeded `"TBD"` so the
dev DB ends this session at exactly its original 7 seeded rows (confirmed
via direct `psql` query). `npm test` 287/287, `npx tsc --noEmit`/`eslint .`
clean, `next build` clean with `/admin-rewards`, `/api/rewards`,
`/api/admin/rewards`, and `/api/admin/rewards/[id]` all listed.

**Follow-up, same day, caught late by the product owner:** two fields were
missing from the original 6.7/6.8/6.9 design — universal to every category,
not per-category:
- [x] `creditCost` (Decimal, per-item) — how many earned credits a
  redemption of this item costs. Admin-editable in the same
  `RewardItemModal`, shown on every card in both the admin list and
  `RewardsCatalogueModal`.
- [x] `quantityAvailable` (Int, nullable — null = unlimited) + `redeemedCount`
  (Int, server-only, never accepted from the admin PATCH/POST body) — how
  many total redemptions admin is willing to give out. When
  `redeemedCount >= quantityAvailable`, the item is "Fully Redeemed" (a
  computed `fullyRedeemed` flag, `lib/reward-catalogue.ts`'s
  `isFullyRedeemed`) and shows a "Fully Redeemed" badge in both UIs.

**Important, explicitly flagged rather than silently glossed over: this is
display/capacity-tracking only.** `redeemedCount` can never actually
increment yet — no redemption/issuance flow exists anywhere in this
codebase for the catalogue (confirmed still true, same gap Sprint 6.6/6.7
already flagged: only server-side `lib/reward-grants.ts` redemption logic
exists, and that's for the unrelated `RewardGrant` discount-redemption
mechanic, not this catalogue). Building an actual "user spends N earned
credits, gets a `RewardGrant`/redemption row, `redeemedCount` increments" flow
is a separate, still-open item for whenever this catalogue's real
issuance/redemption path gets built.

Migration `20260722060956_reward_catalogue_credit_cost_quantity`. Verified
live: seeded placeholder `creditCost`s (Discount Voucher 50, VC Pitch Ticket
500, etc.) and `quantityAvailable` caps render correctly in both UIs;
`npm test` (re-ran `test:db:setup` for the new migration), `tsc`, `eslint`,
`next build` all clean.

- [x] **Real redemption/issuance flow — closed 2026-07-22, same day.** The
  gap flagged immediately above (`redeemedCount` had no writer anywhere) is
  now closed. New `RewardRedemption` model (migration
  `20260722063112_reward_redemptions`) — a user spending earnedBalance on a
  catalogue item, distinct from `RewardGrant` (that's a server-issued
  booking/purchase *discount*, not a standalone catalogue purchase).
  `itemName`/`itemCategory`/`creditCost` are snapshotted onto the row at
  redemption time (same principle as `Booking.platformCommissionPercent`
  elsewhere in this schema) so an admin editing or hard-deleting the
  catalogue item afterward can't reshuffle or blank out what the user
  actually redeemed — `rewardCatalogueItemId` itself is nullable/`SetNull`,
  not the source of truth for display. `POST /api/rewards/[id]/redeem`
  (`redeemRewardCatalogueItem`, `lib/reward-redemptions.ts`): row-locks the
  catalogue item (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, same concurrency pattern as
  `enrollUser`'s capacity guard in `lib/training-enrollments.ts`), rejects
  inactive/fully-redeemed/not-found items, checks earnedBalance via a new
  `assertSufficientEarnedBalance` (`lib/credits.ts`, mirrors
  `assertSufficientPurchasedBalance`), then atomically creates the
  `RewardRedemption` row, increments `redeemedCount`, writes an
  `earned_spend` Transaction, and logs a new `reward_redeemed`
  `ActivityActionType`. `GET /api/rewards/redemptions` (the caller's own
  rows) replaces `RewardsCatalogueModal.tsx`'s `PLACEHOLDER_ACTIVE_VOUCHERS`
  — "View redeemed rewards" is real now. Each catalogue card also gained a
  Redeem button (disabled + "Not enough credits" when the balance is short,
  hidden when fully redeemed).
  `creditCost` itself is stored on `RewardCatalogueItem` as a "credits"
  display-unit figure, same as `AdminRewards.tsx`'s own input — converted to
  true SGD via `creditsToSgd()` once, at the ledger-write boundary, same
  discipline as every other read/write of that ratio (`lib/credit-units.ts`).
  Tests: `lib/reward-redemptions.test.ts` (6 cases — success incl. exact
  ledger amount, insufficient balance, inactive, fully-redeemed, not-found,
  unlimited-quantity repeat redemption), registered in `npm test` (293/293).
  Verified live (`ethan@example.com`, real dev server/DB): granted a
  temporary 100-credit earned balance via direct `psql` insert, redeemed
  "Discount Voucher" (50 credits) through the actual UI — balance dropped to
  50, `redeemedCount` went to 1, the transaction/activity-log rows appeared
  correctly, "View redeemed rewards" showed the real row; confirmed a direct
  `POST /api/rewards/10/redeem` (VC Pitch Ticket, 500 credits, insufficient
  balance) returned a clean 422 and wrote nothing; confirmed an unknown id
  returned a clean 404. All test transactions/activity-log/redemption rows
  deleted and `redeemed_count` reset afterward — dev DB confirmed back to
  its exact seeded state. `npx tsc --noEmit`/`eslint` clean, `next build`
  clean with `/api/rewards/[id]/redeem` and `/api/rewards/redemptions` both
  listed.

## Sprint 6.10: Open Design Threads (planning only, not yet built)

Two unrelated design threads, both explicitly **not built yet** — logged
together under one sprint number per this file's own "figure out X"
convention (see Sprint 6.7's original "TBD when this sprint starts"
phrasing), not guessed at.

### Supplier Tier — Automatic Calculation — Closed 2026-07-22

Raised by the product owner same session as the reward-catalogue follow-up
above; confirmed and built the same day the Supplier Financials page's tier
card asked the open questions below back to the product owner.

- [x] `Company.supplierTier` (free/preferred/top) was **manual-only** —
  `PATCH /api/admin/companies/[id]/supplier-tier`, system-admin-set. Now
  **automatically computed**, admin override **removed entirely** (not just
  supplemented) — the column, the enum, the admin route, and the admin
  `<select>` are all gone, replaced by a live calculation
  (`lib/supplier-tiers.ts`, `getCompanySupplierTier`/`getCompanySupplierTierStats`),
  same "never stored denormalized" principle as `getCreditBalance`/
  `getUserRewardTier`. Migration `20260722070000_remove_supplier_tier_column`.
- [x] Open questions resolved, confirmed by the product owner 2026-07-22 (not
  guessed at):
  - **Rating**: the live average across the company's entire listed
    inventory, all-time (not windowed) — `prisma.rating.aggregate({ where:
    { listing: { companyId } } })`, no minimum sample size (an unrated
    company simply can't clear the rating bar for preferred/top yet).
  - **Spend**: "the same as user tier" — gross `Booking.sgdAmount` of the
    company's own COMPLETED bookings, summed over the identical rolling
    3-month window as the user reward tier (`REWARD_TIER_WINDOW_MONTHS`,
    `lib/reward-tiers.ts`), not net of commission.
  - **Thresholds**: confirmed correct against the product-owner-provided
    infographic (`public/rewards/supplier-reward-tiers-infographic.png`) —
    preferred: 4.0★ AND 50,000 credits (S$5,000) spend; top: 4.5★ AND
    100,000 credits (S$10,000) spend. BOTH dimensions required at each
    tier, same "AND, not OR" model as the user reward tier.
  - No existing aggregate covered this — `getCompanySupplierTierStats` is a
    new live query, not a repurposed `SupplierPayable`/booking aggregate,
    since none of the existing ones combine rating with a rolling-window
    booking sum.
- [x] Removed the manual tier `<select>` in `AdminUsersCompanies.tsx`'s
  Companies tab — replaced with a read-only `SupplierTierBadge`. No manual
  override left to fight the automatic calculation.
- [x] Supplier-facing UI — built on the new Supplier Financials page
  (`(supplier)/supplier-financials/page.tsx`, see that section above), not
  the main supplier dashboard as originally proposed (the product owner's
  own Financials-page UI spec superseded that placement guess). Real
  progress bar wired to `company.tierStats.progressPercent`
  (`GET /api/supplier/company`), "View Tier Benefits" link opens
  `SupplierTierBenefitsModal.tsx` showing the same infographic.

**Verified live** (`ben@acmecoworking.sg`, `alice.admin@spacesnap.sg`): the
Financials page's Supplier Tier card shows a real "Free" with a 0%-filled
progress bar (Acme Coworking has no ratings and no completed-booking spend
in the current window); the admin Companies tab shows a plain read-only
"Free" badge for all three seeded companies, no `<select>` present.
`npm test` 293/293 (including the two `invoicingCadence === "monthly"`
assertions in `bookings.test.ts`/`check-ins.test.ts`, which still hold since
fresh test companies naturally compute to free-tier with zero rating/spend).
`npx tsc --noEmit`, `eslint .` (2 pre-existing errors elsewhere, confirmed
via `git stash` unrelated to this change), and `next build` all clean.

### Rewards Catalogue — per-category redemption/fulfillment — mostly built 2026-07-22

The design threads below were confirmed with the product owner over two
rounds of questions (four design + four detail), then built the same day —
see CLAUDE1.md "Rewards Catalogue — Per-Category Fulfillment (2026-07-22)"
for the full write-up. `events`/`lucky_draw` remain explicitly deferred.
Migration `20260722080000_reward_catalogue_fulfillment`. **Verified:** `npm
test` 304/304 (11 new cases), `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build` clean, and live
cookie-jar HTTP verification of every path (discount→grant+90d expiry,
partner required/valid/invalid, tier_upgrade boost + single-active guard,
admin concierge resolve + 403 guards) — dev DB restored to seeded baseline
afterward. See CLAUDE1.md's "Verification — all green" section.

- [x] **`discount` (Discount Voucher) — built.** Redeeming mints a real
  `RewardGrant(booking_discount_pct, value = item.discountPercent,
  grantedVia: "rewards_catalogue")` with a **90-day expiry** (confirmed).
  `BookingModal`'s new "Have a voucher?" `<select>` (wired to the new
  `GET /api/rewards/grants`) applies it via the already-existing
  `rewardGrantId` create-booking param. **Closes the standing "New known gap,
  2026-07-21 — RewardGrant issuance" item under Sprint 3.5** — this is the
  first real issuance path for a `RewardGrant`.
  - Resolved: **grant expires after 90 days** (`DISCOUNT_VOUCHER_GRANT_EXPIRY_DAYS`,
    lazily enforced on read/redeem — same idiom as CreditHold/BookingCredit).
  - Resolved: `GET /api/rewards/grants` (`listAvailableRewardGrants`) now
    lists a user's own available/unexpired grants — populates the dropdown.
  - Resolved: **`certification_fee` removed** from `RewardDiscountAppliesTo`
    (nothing charges a cert fee; verified no row used it before dropping the
    enum value).
- [x] **`pitch_ticket` / `consultancy` — built.** Redeeming opens a
  `PartnerPickerModal`, the choice is validated against the item's own
  `partnerOptions` and snapshotted onto the redemption, which starts
  `pending`. Surfaced on the Admin Overview page as a new "Pending Concierge
  Requests" row (`ConciergeReviewModal`), where the admin marks it `used` or
  `cancelled`.
  - Resolved: **one item, multiple partner options** — `partnerName` (single)
    replaced by `partnerOptions String[]`; the admin adds a list, the user
    picks one at redemption.
  - Resolved: **admin-queue-only notification** — no `Notification`/broadcast
    change; the `GET /api/admin/reward-redemptions` list item *is* the
    notification.
  - Resolved: **`pending → used | cancelled`** state machine.
- [ ] **`events` (Exclusive Event Invite) — explicitly deferred, do not
  build.** Product owner still deciding the events side of the business.
- [ ] **`lucky_draw` (Lucky Draw Ticket) — explicitly deferred, do not
  build, same reason as `events`.** Confirmed shape for whenever it does get
  built: redeeming enters the user into a draw drawn on a set date, prize TBD.
- [x] **`tier_upgrade` (Premium Tier Upgrade) — built.** Redeeming resolves +
  stores `expiresAt = now + upgradeDurationMonths`; `getUserRewardTier` bumps
  the *effective* tier one level while active.
  - Resolved: **compute-underneath, override display only** — the live
    rolling-window computation keeps running (never paused/snapshotted); on
    expiry there's no reset step, the live tier just takes back over. New
    `baseTier`/`tierUpgradeActive`/`tierUpgradeExpiresAt` on `GET /api/me`,
    surfaced on the dashboard's User Tier card.
  - Resolved: **a second upgrade while one is active is rejected** (no
    stacking/extension).
- [x] **`consumable` (Consumable Redemption) — unchanged, already correct.**
  Immediately-terminal `used` row, no fulfillment step.
- [x] **Cross-cutting: user-facing redemption status — built.** New
  `RewardRedemptionStatus` (`pending`/`used`/`cancelled`) on
  `RewardRedemption`; shown as a status badge under "View redeemed rewards"
  (`RewardsCatalogueModal.tsx`). `discount`/`consumable`/`tier_upgrade` are
  created directly `used`; only `pitch_ticket`/`consultancy` start `pending`.

### Supplier Financials Page — UI built 2026-07-22, backend deliberately not wired

New `/supplier-financials` page (nav item added to `SupplierNavbar.tsx`,
between Requests and Profile), built per the product owner's own direct UI
spec for this session — **UI only, on the product owner's own explicit
instruction to build the visual design first and track backend wiring here
rather than build it now.** Nothing below is guessed at; it's the list of
what a future session needs to decide/build before any of this is real.

- [x] **Supplier Tier card** — real data, not a placeholder. Shows the
  supplier tier + its derived invoicing cadence (both exposed via
  `GET /api/supplier/company`, `serializeCompanyDetails`/`lib/company.ts`)
  and the logged-in user's own real `referralCode` (`GET /api/me`, same
  field the user dashboard's Tier card already reads — no new backend needed
  for this part). **Progress bar + tier itself went fully live later the
  same day** — see "Supplier Tier — Automatic Calculation — Closed
  2026-07-22" above; at the time this line was first written the tier was
  still `Company.supplierTier`, a manual admin-set column, which no longer
  exists. Mirrors the user dashboard's "User Tier" card layout, per the
  still-open Sprint
  6.10 "Supplier-facing UI" item above — this closes that item's placement
  question (main supplier dashboard was the original proposal; the product
  owner instead specified the new Financials page for this session, so
  placed there instead).
- [x] **Purchased/Earned Credits cards — built + verified 2026-07-22.**
  Confirmed with the product owner: a real company-level credit ledger (its
  own `CompanyTransaction` model/table, migration
  `20260722090000_company_transactions` — deliberately separate from
  `Transaction`, not a `companyId` column bolted onto it, since
  `Transaction.userId` is required and an automatic rebate isn't any one
  member's action), real balance now, no spend flow yet. **Earned**: an
  automatic rebate on completed bookings (`grantCompanyBookingRebate`,
  `lib/company-credits.ts`, wired into `checkOutCheckIn` alongside
  `createCompletedBookingPayable`/`grantRewardTierRebate`), sized off the
  company's own live-computed supplier tier — free 1% / preferred 1.5% /
  top 2%, **this session's own inference on the exact percentages, not
  confirmed with the product owner** (flagged in `lib/company-credits.ts`'s
  own comment, same posture as the Sprint 6 cancellation-window percentages
  before their confirmation). **Purchased**: a real top-up flow, any company
  member can trigger it (`POST /api/supplier/company/topup`, no
  isCompanyAdmin-only gate), credits-only for now (no real Stripe charge, same
  posture as the per-user wallet top-up). `GET /api/supplier/company` now
  returns real `purchasedCredits`/`earnedCredits`; the Financials page's two
  cards read real data and the Purchased card gained a "Top Up" button
  (`CompanyTopUpModal.tsx`). Verified live (`ben@acmecoworking.sg`): balance
  0→1000→1500 across two top-ups (additive), negative amount → 422,
  non-supplier → 403; `npm test` 311/311 (7 new cases in
  `lib/company-credits.test.ts`, including a fresh free-tier company's
  completed booking earning exactly 1%), `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build` clean.
- [x] **"Platform Revenue" by listing type — built + verified 2026-07-22.**
  New `getCompanyRevenueByTypeAndMonth` (`lib/revenue.ts`) groups the caller's
  own company's revenue transactions by listing type (space/equipment/
  consumable) per calendar month, reusing the same `REVENUE_TRANSACTION_TYPES`/
  negate-to-net-out-refunds semantics as every other aggregate in that module.
  New `GET /api/supplier/revenue/by-type` accepts a `?months=` range param
  (clamped to 3/6/12); the page's date-range toggle now refetches per range
  (`useSupplierRevenueByType`) instead of slicing placeholder data
  client-side, and the chart's placeholder `buildPlaceholderRevenueByType` is
  gone. Live-verified (cookie-jar login as `ben@acmecoworking.sg`): `months=6`
  returned 6 rows with the current month showing `space=4200` credits (Acme's
  real completed-booking revenue), `months=3`→3 rows, `months=99`→clamped to
  12, non-supplier → 403. `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build`/`npm test` (304/304) all
  clean.
- [ ] **Accounts Receivable, Receipts & Invoices — relocated, not newly
  built.** Moved as-is from the Supplier Profile page (same placeholder
  copy) per the product owner's request. Still the same standing gap flagged
  since Sprint 3 — no Invoice/Receipt/payout concept in the schema at all,
  blocked on Sprint 6's unbuilt Stripe supplier-payout mechanics, unaffected
  by this session.
- [x] **Supplier Rewards Catalogue — closed 2026-07-23.** Real schema,
  redemption flow, and admin/supplier UI, replacing the placeholder modal
  (`components/SupplierRewardsCatalogueModal.tsx`) and its hardcoded
  `PLACEHOLDER_REWARDS` array. Every open question below was resolved by
  inspecting the codebase's own precedent rather than re-asking the product
  owner from scratch, since each had a directly analogous, already-confirmed
  decision elsewhere in this same file:
  - **Schema home: a separate model**, per this item's own "likely cleaner"
    note — new `SupplierRewardCatalogueItem`/`SupplierRewardRedemption`
    models (migration `20260722162116_supplier_reward_catalogue`), company-
    scoped (`companyId`, `redeemedByUserId` records which member clicked
    redeem) rather than user-scoped. New `SupplierRewardCategory`
    (`report`/`ad`/`system`) and `SupplierReportTargetGroup`
    (`bookings`/`equipment`/`consumables`) enums. `CompanyTransactionType`
    gained `earned_spend` — the spender its own schema comment already
    anticipated for `earned_rebate`.
  - **Per-category fields, resolved the same way the "not yet designed" note
    flagged them:** "Targeted Insights Report" got `reportTargetGroups`
    (multi-select, mirrors `discountAppliesTo`'s pattern exactly); `ad` items
    got a generic `campaignDurationDays` (Int) replacing the static "week-
    long"/"priority placement" copy; `system` (Tier Boost) reused the exact
    `upgradeDurationMonths` shape from the user-facing `tier_upgrade`
    category.
  - **Redemption effects, resolved by direct analogy to the already-shipped
    user catalogue (Sprint 6.10 fulfillment session):** `report`/`ad` have no
    automation behind them (no report-generation engine, no ad-serving
    system), so they start `pending` for an admin concierge queue — the
    exact same shape as `pitch_ticket`/`consultancy`. `system` (Tier Boost)
    mirrors `tier_upgrade` exactly: resolves an `expiresAt`, blocks a second
    redemption while one is active, and **does not freeze/snapshot the
    underlying tier computation** — `getCompanySupplierTier`
    (`lib/supplier-tiers.ts`) gained `baseTier`/`tierBoostActive`/
    `tierBoostExpiresAt`, bumping the *effective* tier one level while the
    live rating+spend computation keeps running underneath, same resolution
    the product owner already gave for the user reward tier's own boost —
    this closes the "does it freeze-and-restore or just stop applying"
    question left open in both places by applying that existing answer
    consistently rather than re-deciding it.
  - **Admin UI: a second surface, not a branch on the existing one** — a
    tab switcher (User Catalogue / Supplier Catalogue) inside the existing
    `/admin-rewards` page, `components/AdminSupplierRewards.tsx` as the new
    tab's content, mirroring `AdminRewards.tsx`'s `RewardItemModal` structure
    but scoped to 3 categories. Chosen over teaching the existing admin
    surface to branch on a company-facing item type, since the schema ended
    up as a genuinely separate model — this closes that "which of those two
    paths is right depends on the schema decision" note.
  - New routes: `GET/POST /api/admin/supplier-rewards`,
    `PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/supplier-rewards/[id]`,
    `GET /api/supplier/rewards`, `POST /api/supplier/rewards/[id]/redeem`,
    `GET /api/supplier/rewards/redemptions`,
    `GET /api/admin/supplier-reward-redemptions`,
    `PATCH /api/admin/supplier-reward-redemptions/[id]`. Admin Overview
    gained a second "Pending Supplier Concierge Requests" row alongside the
    existing one.
  - Seeded with the original 6 placeholder items (real rows now, not
    hardcoded UI data), same "starter rows, not a fixed list" convention as
    the user catalogue.
  - **Tests:** `lib/supplier-reward-redemptions.test.ts` (10 cases — success
    with exact ledger debit, insufficient balance, inactive, fully-redeemed,
    not-found, unlimited-quantity repeat redemption, the Tier Boost
    single-active guard + effective-tier bump, resolve used/not-pending/not-
    found), registered in `npm test` (321/321).
  - **Verified live** (real cookie-jar logins against the dev server/DB,
    `ben@acmecoworking.sg` / `alice.admin@spacesnap.sg`): granted a temporary
    2000-credit company earned balance, redeemed "Popup Ad Campaign" through
    the actual UI — balance dropped exactly 2000→1600, "View redeemed
    rewards" showed it `PENDING`; redeemed "Tier Boost" — balance dropped to
    600, the Supplier Tier card live-updated Free→Preferred with "Boosted
    from Free by a Tier Boost, active until 23/10/2026" and Monthly→Biweekly
    invoicing, a second Tier Boost redemption was correctly blocked by the
    UI's own affordability/active-item state; the admin's new "Pending
    Supplier Concierge Requests" queue showed the real pending row
    (company + requesting member), resolving it to Used cleared the queue
    live on both the modal and the Overview page's count. All test
    transactions/redemptions/activity-log rows deleted and `redeemedCount`
    reset afterward — dev DB confirmed back to its exact seeded state via
    direct `psql` query. `npx tsc --noEmit`, `eslint .` clean on every
    touched file, `next build` clean with every new route listed.

### User-Side Buyer Organization — Shared Purchased Credits (raised 2026-07-22, membership built 2026-07-23 — pooled *spend* still not built)

Surfaced while discussing the Sprint 6.5 user reward tier: `User.companyId`
already exists in the schema and isn't gated to `isSupplier` — so nothing
technically stops a plain end-user (not a supplier) from belonging to a
"company" too. Today this is dormant, not an active bug: confirmed by
inspection that no live signup/invite flow ever assigns `companyId` to a
non-supplier user (`app/api/auth/register/route.ts` explicitly has no role/
company field; every non-supplier row with a `companyId` in this codebase
comes only from `prisma/seed.ts`). But it raises a real product question the
product owner then resolved over several turns, confirmed below — a
distinct concept from the Sprint 6.10 supplier-tier thread above and from
`Company` (which stays supplier/seller-only).

- [x] **Reward tier stays strictly individual, confirmed — no pooling.**
  Considered and rejected: pooling company members' bookings/spend into one
  shared tier, with thresholds scaled per member to compensate for the
  inflation pooling would cause. Rejected because scaled thresholds
  mathematically approximate per-capita spend anyway (i.e., close to what
  already exists per-user) while adding real costs the current model
  doesn't have — a threshold that moves every time someone joins/leaves the
  company, which then has to be surfaced in the UI so it doesn't look
  arbitrary. `getUserRewardTierWindowStats` (`lib/reward-tiers.ts`) already
  filters strictly by `userId` with no company join anywhere — this is a
  decision to keep it that way, not a code change.
- [x] **New concept, confirmed distinct from the supplier `Company` model:**
  a buyer-side organization (name TBD, e.g. `BuyerOrganization`) — a
  corporate customer account for a group of employees who share a
  purchased-credit pool, as opposed to `Company` which is a *supplier*
  (lists spaces/equipment/consumables, has certificates/training/payables).
  Reusing `Company` for both was explicitly considered and rejected — it
  would mix two unrelated concerns (seller vs. buyer) into one entity.
- [x] **Only the purchased-credit pool is shared — confirmed, everything
  else stays individual/per-user:**
  - `earnedBalance`, the reward tier, and referrals are entirely unaffected
    — untouched by this feature.
  - **Rebates always go to whichever individual made the spend, never to
    the shared org pool** — even though the *charge* may draw from shared
    company funds, the earned-credit reward for that booking still lands in
    the booking's own user's personal `earnedBalance`, exactly like today.
    This is the direct, confirmed conclusion of "tiers are individual": the
    reward for reaching a tier has to follow the same individual the tier
    itself is computed for.
  - **No separate "purchaser" role** — confirmed, any member of the buyer
    organization can top up the shared pool (unlike `Company`'s
    `isCompanyAdmin`, there's no admin-only gate here). Not yet
    flagged/decided: whether this creates a griefing/abuse surface (any
    member spending down shared funds another member paid for) — noted here
    so a future session doesn't silently assume it's fine, but not blocking
    the rest of this design.
- [x] **Audit trail — confirmed, same toggle idiom as the supplier-side
  Personal/Others thread, but structurally simpler.** The supplier version
  needs a new `ActivityLog.actorUserId` (distinct from the existing
  `userId`) because a supplier can act on a customer's booking — actor and
  subject differ. That problem doesn't exist here: a purchased-credit
  top-up or spend is always self-attributed (the person topping up or
  booking is always the same person the ledger row is about), so **no
  `ActivityLog` schema change is needed for this feature** — only a
  relation-scoped query, same join pattern already used for the supplier
  tier's rating/spend aggregation (`listing.companyId` there → the new
  `User.buyerOrganizationId` here). "Personal" = my own topup/spend rows;
  "Others" = my org-mates' rows (`user.buyerOrganizationId = mine AND userId
  != mine`).
- [x] **Model name/fields, `User.buyerOrganizationId` — closed 2026-07-23.**
  `BuyerOrganization` (`id`, `name`, `registrationNumber`,
  `financeContactEmail`, `financeContactPerson` — full mirror of `Company`'s
  business fields, per the product owner's confirmed answer). `User` gained
  `buyerOrganizationId` (nullable, independent of `companyId`),
  `isBuyerOrgAdmin`, `buyerOrgPromotionRequested` — same additive-capability
  shape as `isCompanyAdmin`, enforced by a sibling
  `users_buyer_org_admin_requires_org` CHECK constraint. Migration
  `20260723072753_buyer_organizations`.
- [x] **`Transaction.buyerOrganizationId` FK — closed 2026-07-23, schema
  only.** Added exactly as scoped (nullable, alongside `userId`) — but the
  pooled-spend write path itself (a booking/purchase actually funded from
  the org's pool) is still **not built**, same "schema now, write path
  later" convention as the gig tables. No UI lets a member choose
  personal-vs-org funds at checkout yet.
- [x] **How a user joins — closed 2026-07-23, confirmed by the product
  owner as part of this session:** search-or-create by name at signup (or
  later, self-service via `POST /api/buyer-organization/join`) — same "join
  or create" flow you already assumed. Refined further, same session: if
  the matched org already has an admin, joining queues a
  `BuyerOrganizationJoinRequest` instead of seating immediately; an
  adminless org (including a freshly created one) seats immediately.
  Promotion to org admin only ever reaches SpaceSnap's system admin when
  the org has no admin at all — once one exists, that admin promotes/removes
  members directly. **The identical rule was retrofitted onto the
  supplier-side `Company` in the same session** (`lib/promotions.ts`
  gained `promoteMemberDirectly`; the existing self-service
  `requestPromotion` now refuses once a company has an admin) — Company
  never had a "join"/"remove member" concept at all before this, only the
  one existing system-admin promotion queue.
- [ ] **Personal/Others toggle + activity feed — still not placed.** The
  membership/admin management UI (join, seat-or-queue, member list,
  remove, promote) is real and live on both the user Financials page
  (`BuyerOrganizationCard`/`ManageBuyerOrganizationModal`) and the supplier
  profile page (`TeamMembersCard`) — but the actual "Personal vs. Others"
  spend-attribution toggle this bullet originally described has no home
  yet, since there's no pooled spend to attribute in the first place (see
  the `Transaction.buyerOrganizationId` item above). Revisit once the
  pooled-spend write path is scoped.
- [x] **Org-admin Overview tab (stats, upcoming bookings, activity, credit
  movement) — closed 2026-07-23, same day, follow-on session.** Distinct
  from the Personal/Others toggle immediately above — this surfaces each
  member's own individual bookings/activity/ledger rows aggregated across
  the org (the `user: { buyerOrganizationId }` join idiom this section's
  own "Personal"/"Others" note describes), not the shared purchased-credit
  pool itself, which still has no spend write-path. New `getBuyerOrgStats`/
  `serializeBuyerOrgStats` (`lib/buyer-organizations.ts`), admin-only `GET
  /api/buyer-organization/stats`, `useBuyerOrgStats` hook. `ManageBuyerOrganizationModal`
  gained a new default "Overview" tab: member/total-booking/upcoming-booking
  stat tiles, an upcoming-bookings list, a Recent Activity feed (audit trail
  — who did what, across every member, not just the acting admin), and a
  Credit Movement feed (recent ledger rows across every member). Verified
  live as `ethan@example.com` (real seeded org admin, "Test" org, 1 member):
  Overview tab showed 3 total bookings / 1 upcoming (Meeting Room B,
  pending) and 4 real Credit Movement rows (top-up + 3 booking debits)
  pulled straight off his seeded ledger; Recent Activity correctly read "No
  activity yet." since none of his seeded rows ever wrote an `ActivityLog`
  entry — not a bug, a reflection of what's actually in the dev DB. Members/
  Join Requests tabs re-verified unaffected. `npm test` 370/370,
  `tsc --noEmit`/`eslint` clean, `next build` clean with the new route
  listed.
- [x] **Recent Activity: pagination + real date-range picker — closed
  2026-07-23, same day, follow-on session.** Prompted by a direct product
  owner question ("is it infinite?") about the two Recent Activity feeds
  above (user dashboard, org Overview tab) — both had grown into flat,
  unbounded lists (100/200-cap and a hardcoded take:20, respectively) with
  only coarse 7/30/90-day/all-time preset buttons, no real date picker, and
  no way to page back through older history. `lib/activity.ts` rewritten:
  `parseActivityQuery`/`getUserActivity` now take `page`/`pageSize`
  (default 10/page, capped at 50) and explicit `from`/`to` ISO dates instead
  of the old flat `limit`/`days`-since preset — `GET /api/activity` returns
  `{ activity, meta: { page, pageSize, total } }`. Mirrored on the org side:
  new `getBuyerOrgActivity`/`serializeBuyerOrgActivityEntry`
  (`lib/buyer-organizations.ts`) and its own admin-only, paginated `GET
  /api/buyer-organization/activity` — split out of the bundled
  `GET /api/buyer-organization/stats` response entirely (`recentActivity`
  removed from `getBuyerOrgStats`/`serializeBuyerOrgStats`) so paging/date
  state doesn't force a refetch of the cheap aggregate numbers next to it.
  New shared `components/Pagination.tsx` (first pagination UI anywhere in
  this codebase — `GET /api/admin/users` already had server-side
  page/skip/take but no frontend ever rendered controls for it, see that
  route's own comment) and `ACTIVITY_DATE_RANGE_PRESETS`/`presetToDateRange`
  (`lib/hooks/useActivity.ts`) — the old 7/30/90/all pills still exist as a
  frontend convenience that computes from/to under the hood, now sitting
  next to two real `<input type="date">` fields for a genuine custom range.
  Both feeds (`app/(user)/user/page.tsx`, `ManageBuyerOrganizationModal.tsx`)
  reset to page 1 on any filter change. Credit Movement (the org modal's
  ledger feed) was deliberately left untouched — the product owner's
  question was specifically about "activity logs," which in this codebase
  means the `ActivityLog`/`ActivityActionType` feed, not the `Transaction`
  ledger; flagged, not silently assumed. New coverage: `lib/activity.test.ts`
  (parseActivityQuery validation, real-DB pagination/date-range/type
  filtering, cross-user isolation) and two new describe blocks in
  `lib/buyer-organizations.test.ts` (`getBuyerOrgStats`/`getBuyerOrgActivity`
  aggregate correctly across every member and never leak another org's
  rows) — both registered in `npm test`. **Verified live**: seeded 15 fake
  `activity_log` rows directly via `psql` (the dev DB had zero real ones —
  nothing seeds this table, and Ethan's own seeded actions never wrote to
  it), confirmed both feeds paginate correctly ("Showing 1–10 of 15" → page
  2 "Showing 11–15 of 15") and the custom from/to inputs filter correctly
  (14 of 15 rows match a specific day), then deleted all 15 rows — dev DB
  confirmed back to its exact pre-verification state (0 `activity_log`
  rows). `npm test` 385/385, `tsc --noEmit`/`eslint` clean, `next build`
  clean with both `/api/activity` and `/api/buyer-organization/activity`
  listed.
- [x] **Extended to every other audit-trail feed (Credit Movement, wallet
  Recent Transactions) — closed 2026-07-23, same day, immediate follow-up.**
  The product owner's explicit instruction after the item above: "anything
  that calls upon for audit trails" gets the same pagination + date picker,
  not just the two `ActivityLog` feeds — closing the "deliberately left
  untouched" scoping note this item's own bullet made a few paragraphs up.
  Two more feeds identified by grep (only two other places in the whole
  codebase render a `Transaction` list): the org modal's own Credit
  Movement section, and the Financials page's Recent Transactions card.
  Both got the identical treatment. New shared
  `lib/hooks/useDateRangeFilter.ts` (preset/from/to/page state + the four
  change handlers, each resetting page to 1) and `components/DateRangePicker.tsx`
  (preset pills + two `<input type="date">` fields) — extracted once a
  third near-identical copy of that block was about to exist; the two
  already-built feeds (dashboard Recent Activity, org modal Recent
  Activity) were refactored onto these shared pieces too, not just the two
  new ones. New `getBuyerOrgTransactions`/`serializeBuyerOrgTransaction`
  (`lib/buyer-organizations.ts`) + admin-only paginated `GET
  /api/buyer-organization/transactions` — `recentTransactions` removed from
  `getBuyerOrgStats`/`serializeBuyerOrgStats` (fourth thing pulled out of
  that bundled response, after Recent Activity above). New
  `lib/wallet-transactions.ts` (`getWalletTransactionsPage`,
  reuses `ActivityQuery`/`parseActivityQuery` from lib/activity.ts, its
  `types` field just unused) + `GET /api/wallet/transactions`. **Important
  distinction preserved, not regressed:** `GET /api/wallet`'s own bundled
  `transactions` field (flat, still take-50) was deliberately left alone —
  the Financials page's derived stats (This Month's Spend, Avg Monthly
  Spend, Balance Trend sparkline) read that field, and paging it down to 10
  would have silently made those stats wrong; the new paginated endpoint is
  a genuinely separate query, used only by the new Recent Transactions
  display list. Every existing mutation that invalidates `["wallet"]`
  (`useTopUp`, `useRedeemReward`, booking cancel/modify, the pending
  booking-credit refund claim) now also invalidates `["wallet-transactions"]`
  so the paginated list refreshes after those actions too. New coverage:
  `lib/wallet-transactions.test.ts` (real-DB pagination/date-range/
  cross-user isolation, mirrors lib/activity.test.ts) and a
  `getBuyerOrgTransactions` describe block in `lib/buyer-organizations.test.ts`
  (aggregates across every member, excludes other orgs) — both registered
  in `npm test`. **Verified live**: seeded 15 fake `transactions` rows for
  Ethan via `psql` (real `updated_at` NOT NULL constraint caught on the
  first attempt — fixed), confirmed the wallet page's Recent Transactions
  paginated correctly ("Showing 1–10 of 19" → page 2 "Showing 11–19 of 19",
  the extra 4 being Ethan's real seeded transactions) while This Month's/Avg
  Monthly Spend stayed at the correct 4200.00 credits throughout (proof the
  stats split didn't regress), and the org modal's Credit Movement
  paginated independently of Recent Activity above it in the same tab, then
  deleted all 15 rows — dev DB confirmed back to its exact prior state.
  `npm test` 389/389, `tsc --noEmit`/`eslint` clean, `next build` clean with
  `/api/buyer-organization/transactions` and `/api/wallet/transactions`
  both listed.
- [x] **At most one organization — confirmed 2026-07-23,** no multi-org
  membership. `User.buyerOrganizationId` is a single nullable scalar FK,
  not a join table — structurally can't hold more than one.

**Built 2026-07-23 (this session):** `lib/buyer-organizations.ts` +
`lib/company-membership.ts` (search, join-or-request, member list, remove,
promote, join-request approve/reject, system-admin promotion queue — the
Company side is new, the BuyerOrganization side mirrors it exactly);
`lib/buyer-org-auth.ts` (`requireBuyerOrgMember`/`requireBuyerOrgAdmin`,
mirrors `lib/supplier-auth.ts`); session/JWT now carry
`isBuyerOrgAdmin`/`buyerOrganizationId` (`auth.ts`, `types/next-auth.d.ts`).
14 new API routes (`/api/buyer-organization*`, `/api/buyer-organizations/search`,
`/api/companies/search`, `/api/supplier/company/members*`,
`/api/supplier/company/join-requests*`, `/api/admin/buyer-org-promotions*`).
`app/api/auth/register/route.ts` rewritten to actually resolve
`role`/`buyerOrganizationName`/`companyName` — this closes the dead-UI
finding that kicked off this whole thread (see the new "Sprint 7.1" section
below). New UI: `components/OrgSearchInput.tsx` (search-or-create
autocomplete, signup + Digital Passport), `components/BuyerOrganizationCard.tsx` +
`ManageBuyerOrganizationModal.tsx`, `TeamMembersCard` (supplier profile
page), a new "Org Promotions" tab in `AdminApprovals.tsx`.
**`BuyerOrganizationCard` relocated the same day** (product owner's own
call, caught during review): originally placed on the Financials/Wallet
page per this section's own earlier placement note, moved instead to the
Digital Passport page — replacing that page's pre-existing "Company"
field, which turned out to be a second, unrelated dead-UI bug (displayed
the *supplier* `Company` name via a free-text input that looked editable
but had no save path anywhere — confirmed by reading the whole edit flow,
no API call backed it). See the "Role Exclusivity" entry below for the
rest of what that review surfaced. Tests: `lib/company-membership.test.ts`,
`lib/promotions.test.ts`, `lib/buyer-organizations.test.ts` — 44 new cases,
all against the real dev/test Postgres DB. **Verified live**: `npm test`
365/365, `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build` clean (every new route listed); real
cookie-jar HTTP walkthrough of every path on both the Company and
BuyerOrganization sides — create org/company, second signup into the same
org while adminless (seats immediately), self-promotion request (allowed,
no admin yet), system-admin approval, a *third* signup into the
now-administered org (correctly queued `pending` instead of seated), the
new admin approving the queued request, direct admin-driven promotion, and
the self-removal guard rejecting an admin trying to remove themselves — all
matched the designed state machine exactly. All test users/company/org rows
deleted afterward, dev DB confirmed back to its exact seeded state.

### Role Exclusivity — Member/Supplier/Both (closed 2026-07-23, same day, follow-on review)

Raised while reviewing the Buyer Organization work above: the "User
Portal"/"Supplier Portal" nav-switch buttons (`UserNavbar.tsx`/
`SupplierNavbar.tsx`) were unconditional — every account saw both, regardless
of role, confirmed by reading both components (no session check at all).
Fixing "Supplier Portal" was simple (gate on `isSupplier`, which already
existed), but "User Portal" exposed a real architecture question: `proxy.ts`
had user routes (`/marketplace`, `/passport`, `/wallet`, `/user`) open to
*every* authenticated account unconditionally — `isSupplier` only ever gated
the supplier routes, meaning a Supplier account already had full user-route
access too, by design ("supplier" was additive on top of a base account, not
a separate account type). Confirmed with the product owner: this should be
fully exclusive instead — picking a role at signup should mean *only* that
role's pages are reachable, not "at least that role."

- [x] **`User.isMember` — new field, not derived from `isSupplier`.**
  Migration `20260723082448_user_is_member`. Necessary because `isSupplier`
  alone can't distinguish "Supplier only" from "Both" (both set it
  identically) — a genuinely separate signal was required. Defaults `true`,
  so every pre-existing row (every seeded account, every account created
  before this field existed) keeps working exactly as before; the
  exclusivity only applies to signups going forward. `lib/signup-roles.ts`
  (new, small, tested): `resolveIsMember(role)` — `false` only for
  `"supplier"`, `true` for `"member"`/`"both"`/no role selected (the
  legacy/API-only registration path).
- [x] **`proxy.ts` gate flipped from unconditional to `isUserRoute &&
  isMember`** — mirrors how `isSupplierRoute && isSupplier` already worked.
  `components/RoleGuard.tsx` (the client-side companion) updated identically
  for consistency, same as every other guard pair in this codebase.
- [x] **Nav buttons fixed**: `UserNavbar.tsx`'s "Supplier Portal" now only
  renders when `isSupplier`; `SupplierNavbar.tsx`'s "User Portal" now only
  renders when `isMember` — both via `useSession()`, matching the pattern
  every other role-gated UI element in this codebase already uses.
- [x] **Tests + verification**: `lib/signup-roles.test.ts` (5 cases, pure
  function, no DB). Full `npm test` **370/370**, `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build`
  clean. **Live-verified** via real cookie-jar HTTP: registered one account
  per role (Member/Supplier/Both), confirmed each session's `isSupplier`/
  `isMember` combination matched exactly, then hit `/marketplace` and
  `/supplier` directly as each — Member-only got `200`/`307` (blocked),
  Supplier-only got `307` (blocked)/`200`, Both got `200`/`200` on both. Also
  confirmed via direct `psql` that pre-existing seeded accounts
  (`alice.admin@spacesnap.sg`, `ben@acmecoworking.sg`, `ethan@example.com`)
  all read `is_member = true` — the grandfathering held. All test
  accounts/companies deleted afterward, dev DB back to its exact seeded
  state.

### Supplier Analytics/Financials Reshuffle + Company Credit Movement (raised 2026-07-23, closed same day)

Three items from the product owner. Grounded against the current pages by
direct inspection (not guessed): "Analytics" (nav label, `SupplierNavbar.tsx`)
routes to `/supplier` (`app/(supplier)/supplier/page.tsx`, component
`SupplierAnalyticsPage`, already had the "Recent Bookings" table);
"Financials" routes to `/supplier-financials`
(`app/(supplier)/supplier-financials/page.tsx`, already had the "Platform
Revenue" card).

- [x] **Move the "Platform Revenue" card from Financials to Analytics —
  closed 2026-07-23.** Relocated `PlatformRevenueCard` (+ its `Pills`/
  `RevenueTooltip` helpers) from `app/(supplier)/supplier-financials/page.tsx`
  to `app/(supplier)/supplier/page.tsx`, replacing the page's old "Revenue
  Over Time" card. **Correction to this item's own premise**: that old card
  was backed by `useSupplierRevenue`/`GET /api/supplier/revenue`
  (`getCompanyRevenueByMonth`, `lib/revenue.ts`), not the relocated card's
  own `useSupplierRevenueByType` as this item originally assumed — the two
  were separate charts (a flat monthly total vs. a by-listing-type
  breakdown). Since Platform Revenue is a strict superset of Revenue Over
  Time (same total, broken down further, with a real 3/6/12-month range
  picker vs. none), the old chart was superseded, not left duplicated —
  removed `useSupplierRevenue`, `GET /api/supplier/revenue`, and
  `getCompanyRevenueByMonth` entirely after confirming by grep they had no
  other callers.
- [x] **Analytics' "Recent Bookings" table pagination + date-range picker —
  closed 2026-07-23.** New `getSupplierBookingsFeed` (`lib/bookings.ts`,
  reuses `ActivityQuery`/`parseActivityQuery` from `lib/activity.ts`, same
  idiom as `getWalletTransactionsPage`) + new `GET /api/supplier/bookings/recent`
  — a **dedicated endpoint**, not pagination bolted onto `GET
  /api/supplier/bookings`, per this item's own note: that route's full
  unpaginated list is still relied on elsewhere (supplier-requests' status
  tabs, supplier-profile's rating aggregate), confirmed by grep before
  touching it. New `useSupplierBookingsFeed` hook, wired into the Recent
  Bookings table with `useDateRangeFilter`/`DateRangePicker`/`Pagination` —
  the exact shared pieces this item called out, not a bespoke copy. The
  "Active Bookings" stat card kept reading the original unpaginated
  `useSupplierBookings()` hook unchanged, since it's a point-in-time count
  unaffected by the table's own date filter.
- [x] **Supplier Financials Credit Movement, company-admin only — closed
  2026-07-23.** New `getCompanyTransactionsPage`/`serializeCompanyTransaction`
  (`lib/company-credits.ts`, direct mirror of `getBuyerOrgTransactions`) +
  new `GET /api/supplier/company/transactions`, gated by the existing
  `requireCompanyAdmin` (`lib/supplier-auth.ts`) — already the right guard,
  no new auth helper needed (it already backs the company business-details
  edit route). New `useCompanyTransactions` hook (defines its own
  `CompanyTransactionType` string union rather than importing the generated
  Prisma enum, matching `BookingStatus`/`ActivityActionType`'s existing
  frontend convention). New `CreditMovementCard` on the Financials page,
  rendered only when `session.user.isCompanyAdmin`.
  - **Verified live** (real cookie-jar HTTP + browser session,
    `ben@acmecoworking.sg` / `chandra@acmecoworking.sg`, both real seeded
    Acme Coworking accounts): topped up 250 credits via the existing
    `POST /api/supplier/company/topup` — the new feed immediately showed the
    real row (`purchased_topup`, +250 credits, "Ben Ong", correct
    description); `chandra` (`isCompanyAdmin: false`) got a real `403` from
    the new route and the Financials page correctly rendered no Credit
    Movement card for her at all, while `ben` saw it. Analytics page
    confirmed via browser session: Platform Revenue renders on `/supplier`
    with real by-type data, Recent Bookings shows the date-range picker and
    all 3 of Acme's seeded bookings. Test top-up row deleted via direct
    `psql` afterward — dev DB confirmed back to its exact prior state
    (0 `company_transactions` rows for Acme).
  - `npm test` **389/389**, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx eslint .` clean on
    every touched file (2 pre-existing errors elsewhere, confirmed via
    `git stash` unrelated to this session), `next build` clean — both new
    routes listed, `/api/supplier/revenue` gone.

## Sprint 6.11: Railway + Cloudflare R2 Deployment Readiness (raised 2026-07-22)

Sprint 0 already *decided* Railway (front/back/DB) + R2 (file storage) as the
stack — this sprint is the gap between that decision and an actual deploy.
No Railway project, `railway.json`, `Dockerfile`, or README deployment
section exists in this repo yet (confirmed by `find`/grep), so nothing below
is assumed done just because Sprint 0 checked it off. Everything below was
found by direct inspection of this session's own codebase (`package.json`,
`auth.ts`, `lib/storage.ts`, `node_modules/next/dist/docs`, `@auth/core`'s
own source), not guessed — same "don't invent, verify" posture as the rest
of this file. Split into **code fixes** (do in this repo) and **external
dashboard steps** (Railway/Cloudflare/Stripe consoles — outside what a
session in this repo can provision, same category as the existing
Sprint 3.5/Sprint 6 cron/webhook notes).

**Code fixes — concrete, found by inspection, not yet done:**
- [x] **Prisma Client isn't generated anywhere in the build pipeline — closed
  2026-07-22.** Added `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to `package.json`.
  Verified: `npm install` (adding `sharp`, see below) regenerated
  `app/generated/prisma` on its own, confirmed by the file's fresh mtime and
  a clean `npx prisma generate` re-run immediately after.
- [x] **No production migration step — closed 2026-07-22.** Added
  `"db:migrate:deploy": "prisma migrate deploy"` (no `DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH`
  override, so it reads the real `DATABASE_URL` — `.env` locally, Railway's
  env vars in production) — intentionally a separate script, not folded into
  `build`, so it can be wired as Railway's own deploy-command/release-phase
  step per the reasoning above. Verified live against the local dev DB: `npm
  run db:migrate:deploy` found all 36 existing migrations already applied,
  reported "No pending migrations to apply," no schema drift. The seed
  guardrail is a runtime discipline note, not code — nothing to close there.
- [x] **`AUTH_TRUST_HOST` / `AUTH_URL` missing — closed 2026-07-22.** Added
  `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=""` to `.env.example` with a comment explaining exactly
  why it's required in production and why local dev doesn't need it (dev
  already defaults `trustHost` to `true`). The real `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true`
  (or `AUTH_URL=https://<domain>`) still needs to be set in Railway's actual
  environment variables once a domain exists — that half is an external
  step, tracked below, not something a local `.env.example` edit can do by
  itself.
- [x] **Node version isn't pinned — closed 2026-07-22.** Added `"engines":
  {"node": ">=20.9.0"}` to `package.json` (matches Next.js's own declared
  floor, `node_modules/next/package.json`, rather than an arbitrary pin) and
  `.nvmrc` set to `26.5.0` (this session's actual verified-working local
  version).
- [x] **`sharp` isn't a direct dependency — closed 2026-07-22.** `npm install
  --save-dev sharp` — resolved `^0.35.3` (already present transitively at a
  compatible version, so no new native binary download, just promoted to a
  direct/top-level dependency).
- [ ] **`output: 'standalone'` — optional, not required.** Per Next.js's own
  docs, a plain Node server via `next start` is already a fully-supported
  minimum deployment target; `standalone` only trims the deploy image via
  output file tracing. Worth turning on for a smaller/faster Railway build,
  but not a blocker — don't treat this as load-bearing.

**External dashboard/infra steps — cannot be done from inside this repo,
tracked here so they aren't silently assumed done:**
- [ ] **R2 bucket CORS configuration.** `lib/storage.ts`'s presigned-PUT
  evidence-upload flow (the tier2a signoff evidence recording, the one real
  R2 consumer in this app today) has the *browser* PUT directly to R2. The
  R2 bucket itself needs a CORS policy allowing `PUT`/`GET` from the
  production origin — an R2 dashboard/API step, not something `lib/storage.ts`
  can configure itself.
- [ ] **Separate R2 bucket + credentials for production**, distinct from
  whatever `R2_BUCKET_NAME`/dev credentials are in local `.env` today (per
  `.env.example`'s own `R2_BUCKET_NAME="spacesnap-dev"` default — a name
  that shouldn't also be the production bucket).
- [ ] **Stripe webhook endpoint pointed at the real Railway URL.** The
  webhook route (`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`) and its signature
  verification already exist and are tested (Sprint 6, closed 2026-07-21) —
  what's missing is a real Stripe Dashboard webhook endpoint configured
  against `https://<railway-domain>/api/webhooks/stripe`, and that
  endpoint's own real signing secret set as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in
  Railway's environment (today's `.env.example` value is explicitly a local
  `stripe listen`/placeholder one, per that variable's own comment).
- [ ] **Railway Cron Schedule service for `/api/cron/resolve-pending-booking-credits`.**
  Already flagged in that route's own code comment (Sprint 6.5-era) as
  needing a Railway "Cron Schedule" service configured to `POST` it daily
  with `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` — still not provisioned.
  Without it, `BookingCredit`'s forced-refund deadline has no hard,
  log-in-independent guarantee (only the lazy read-time sweep covers a user
  who's actively looking).
- [ ] **Railway environment variables set from real production values, not
  copied from local `.env`** — `DATABASE_URL` (Railway's own Postgres
  plugin), `AUTH_SECRET` (a freshly generated one, not the dev value),
  `R2_*`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (still
  Stripe *test*-mode keys at this stage — going live on Stripe is a separate,
  already-flagged decision under Sprint 6's "developer review required
  before going live," not bundled into this sprint), `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
  `CRON_SECRET`.
- [ ] **Confirm Railway Postgres connection behavior under Prisma** —
  connection pool limits/`sslmode` under Railway's managed Postgres,
  especially across container restarts/redeploys. Not verified against a
  real Railway Postgres instance yet, only local Postgres.

**Still-open item this sprint directly closes the reason for** — Sprint 3's
own checklist has carried `[ ] CORS/cookie behavior confirmed in a deployed
(not just localhost) environment` since that sprint. This sprint is what
finally puts a real deployed environment in front of that check; tick it
there once this sprint's auth/cookie items are verified live on Railway, not
here.

**Checklist before calling this sprint done:**
- [x] Every "Code fixes" item above merged and green (`npm test`, `tsc
  --noEmit`, `eslint .`, `next build`) — closed 2026-07-22: `npm test`
  293/293, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx eslint .` shows only pre-existing
  warnings/errors unrelated to any touched file (confirmed via `git stash` —
  identical count on `main` before this session's changes), `next build`
  clean with `proxy.ts` and every route listed. `output: 'standalone'`
  deliberately left undone, per its own item's "optional, not required"
  note.
- [ ] A real deploy exists at a Railway URL, logged into successfully (closes
  the `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` item's actual risk, not just the code being present)
- [ ] Sprint 3's stale CORS/cookie checklist item ticked from the real
  deployed environment, not localhost
- [ ] One real booking's Stripe charge + webhook round-trip verified against
  the deployed URL (not `stripe listen` against localhost)

## Sprint 6.12: Broadcast Notifications, EDM Popups, Supplier Profile Reshuffle, Monetization Catalogue (raised 2026-07-23, planning only)

Five items from the product owner, not yet built — captured here as a
planning-only sprint, same convention as Sprint 6.10. **Numbered 6.12, not
6.11 as originally requested** — 6.11 already exists (Railway + Cloudflare
R2 Deployment Readiness) and is an unrelated deployment-readiness sprint;
renumbered rather than overwriting/merging into it. Several of these are
genuinely open-ended ("Content TBD," "Details TBD" in the original ask) —
left that way below rather than inventing specifics.

- [ ] **Admin UI — broadcast a notification to all Members.** Appears in
  every member's existing notification panel (`components/NotificationsPanel.tsx`);
  clicking it opens a modal (content TBD). New ground, not a relocation:
  `Notification` (`prisma/schema.prisma`) is a one-row-per-user model with
  no broadcast/announcement concept today, and no notification type
  currently opens a modal on click — every existing row just marks itself
  read on click (`NotificationsPanel.tsx`, confirmed by reading the handler).
  Needs a design decision before building: fan out one `Notification` row
  per Member at send time (simple, matches the existing read/unread model
  exactly, but a large broadcast is a lot of rows) vs. a new
  `Announcement`-style model each `Notification` row references (one row of
  actual content, cheap fan-out, but a new relation and a new "isRead"
  tracking shape to design). Not decided here — flagged for whoever picks
  this up.
- [ ] **Admin UI — broadcast a notification to all Suppliers.** Same
  mechanic and same open design question as the Member broadcast above,
  scoped to `isSupplier` instead.
- [ ] **Supplier and Admin — EDM upload that pops up on sign-in, and again
  after sign-out once the account has been inactive for at least 6 hours.**
  Genuinely new concept — grep confirms no `Announcement`/banner/popup
  mechanism exists anywhere in this codebase today. Needs at least: where
  the upload lives (new admin + supplier UI), what "inactive for 6 hours"
  is measured against (last sign-in timestamp? last request? no session
  activity tracking currently exists to answer this), and whether Supplier-
  authored and Admin-authored EDMs are the same content slot or two
  independent ones. Ties into the "Buying of ads" catalogue item below —
  worth designing both together rather than twice.
- [ ] **Supplier Profile — move Team Members card to the left column.**
  Today's layout (`app/(supplier)/supplier-profile/page.tsx`): the left
  column (`lg:col-span-1`) holds the avatar/profile card +
  `CompanyAdminAccessCard`; the right column (`lg:col-span-2`) holds
  `BusinessDetailsCard`, `TeamMembersCard`, then the Accounts
  Receivable/Receipts cards. `TeamMembersCard` moves to the left column,
  under the existing profile card.
- [ ] **Listing stats → Analytics, integrated into the top 2 cards.**
  Checked before writing this down: no "listing stats" section currently
  exists anywhere in this codebase (`app/(supplier)/supplier-inventory/page.tsx`
  has no stats block, confirmed by grep) — so this isn't a relocation of an
  existing feature, it's new scope to design, framed as feeding into
  Analytics' existing `StatCard` pair ("Active Bookings"/"Total Listings",
  `app/(supplier)/supplier/page.tsx`). What "listing stats" should actually
  contain (views? bookings per listing? something else?) is undecided —
  flagged, not guessed.
- [ ] **Supplier Profile — move Business Details down; add a purchasable
  listing-boost catalogue above it, placeholder cards.** Business Details
  (`BusinessDetailsCard`) moves below a new catalogue section in the right
  column. Catalogue items, per the product owner, all placeholder/TBD
  content at this stage:
  - **Lab Digest** — a purchasable report on who's new on SpaceSnap
    (buyer organizations), buying trends, etc. Content/format TBD.
  - **Ads** — buying a popup ad slot, surfaced via the same EDM popup
    mechanism from the item above (not a separate delivery path).
  - **Newsletter space** — purchasable placement in a newsletter. Content
    TBD; no newsletter concept exists anywhere in this codebase today.
  - **Bumps** — pushes the supplier's listing to page 1 of marketplace
    search results. Depends on marketplace listings actually having pages:
    confirmed by inspection that `GET /api/listings` has no `take`/`skip`
    today (`app/api/listings/route.ts`) — the marketplace is unpaginated,
    same gap every other feed in this codebase had before the Recent
    Activity/Credit Movement pagination work above. **Marketplace listings
    need real pagination (10 at a time) as a prerequisite for this item**,
    not an unrelated nice-to-have — "page 1" isn't a meaningful concept
    until pagination exists.
  - **Pin** — pins the listing to the very top of marketplace results,
    above bumped listings. Mechanics TBD (relative ordering vs. bumps,
    duration, whether multiple suppliers can pin simultaneously).

---

## Sprint 7: Dashboard, Polish, and Full Re-Verification

- [x] **"Credits" labeling on booking prices — Terms of Service clarification needed, not a UI bug.** `BookingModal.tsx`, the marketplace listing cards/detail panel, and the supplier inventory page all display `priceDay`/`priceWeek`/`priceMonth` with a price suffix even though, since the 2026-07-21 write-path session, a booking is charged real-time SGD via Stripe and never touches any credit balance (confirmed against `lib/bookings.ts` — `Booking.sgdAmount` is set directly from these fields). **Decision (2026-07-21): keep the display as a cosmetic unit, do not relabel to SGD** — "Credits" at checkout is being kept purely as a cosmetic display unit, solely to present the SGD price of a booking. **Correction (2026-07-21, same day): the abbreviated "cr" suffix itself was wrong — the product owner wants the full word "Credits", never the "cr" shorthand, anywhere in the app.** Swept every remaining `cr` abbreviation (30 occurrences across `app/(user)/marketplace/page.tsx`, `app/(supplier)/supplier-inventory/page.tsx`, `app/(supplier)/supplier/page.tsx`, `app/(supplier)/supplier-requests/page.tsx`, `app/(user)/user/page.tsx`, `app/(user)/wallet/page.tsx`, `app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/(admin)/admin-financials/page.tsx`, `components/PendingBookingCreditModal.tsx`, `components/ConfirmBulkOrderModal.tsx`) and replaced with the full word "credits", matching the wording the booking/purchase modals already used. Verified live against the dev server (`ethan@example.com`): wallet shows "80 Credits"/"420.00 credits", marketplace listing cards show "120 credits"/"18.5 credits / unit", no bare "cr" left anywhere (`grep -rn '\bcr\b' --include="*.tsx"` zero hits outside `node_modules`). `npx tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` clean on every touched file. The ToS clarification section below is still needed, now written against "Credits" as the unit name (no abbreviation to define away):

  > "Credits" displayed throughout the app are a cosmetic unit of display, fixed at 1 credit = S$0.10 (10 credits = S$1), used solely to present the Singapore Dollar value of a booking, purchase, or wallet balance. Credits are not a stored value, wallet balance, prepaid instrument, or currency; they cannot be purchased, held, transferred, or redeemed independently of the specific transaction in which they are shown, and confer no rights beyond that transaction.

  This is deliberately scoped to the booking-checkout "cr" label only — it does not apply to `pricePerUnit` (consumables), which stays genuinely `purchasedBalance`-funded and unaffected. Whatever ToS document/page this rewrite ends up shipping needs this as its own section.

  **Amendment, 2026-07-21 — credit:SGD ratio changed from 1:1 to 1:10 (1 credit = S$0.10), per product owner decision.** The ratio is a pure display-layer constant (`CREDITS_PER_SGD`, `lib/credit-units.ts`) applied at exactly two points: every API serializer that returns a currency figure to the client (`sgdToCredits`) and every API parser that accepts one from the client — a supplier's listing price, a wallet top-up amount, an admin goodwill `BookingCredit` grant (`creditsToSgd`). Every internal Decimal — `Booking.sgdAmount`, `Transaction.amount`, Stripe charge cents (`lib/stripe.ts`'s `toStripeCents`), commission/refund/payout math (`lib/booking-payments.ts`, `lib/supplier-payables.ts`) — stays true SGD, unconverted, end to end; the ratio never enters business logic, only the read/write edges of the API. Confirmed this holds for every derived client-side calculation too (`CancelBookingModal`/`ModifyBookingModal`'s refund/fee previews, `BookingModal`'s credit-applied/leftover math) — they all operate on already-converted numbers from the API (e.g. `booking.sgdAmount`), so no frontend component needed a code change beyond `TopUpCreditsModal`'s hardcoded `PRESET_AMOUNTS` (scaled ×10 to keep the same real S$10/S$25/S$50/S$100 presets, not a tenth of them). `lib/earned-balance-guard.test.ts`'s structural rule (no API route may serialize a field literally named `earnedBalance`) is unaffected — the new `GET /api/wallet` `earned` field is a "credits" unit count, same cosmetic-display framing as `purchased`, never a raw SGD/dollar figure.
- [ ] Supplier dashboard: manage spaces, view bookings, access logs
- [x] Notifications: booking confirmations, credential expiry alerts — closed 2026-07-21 as part of the BookingCredit feature (real `Notification` backend, `booking_confirmed`/`cert_expiry`/`credit_topup`/`cert_earned`/`booking_credit_pending` all wired; `cert_expiry` swept daily via the same cron as the BookingCredit forced-refund job). "Access events" (check-in/out) still not wired — no notification type exists for those, and Sprint 4.5 already flagged check-ins themselves as kiosk-only/deferred to Sprint 5, not this repo's job yet.
- [ ] Final responsive/polish pass
- [ ] **Re-run the full PreUAT checklist against the new stack** — every item that passed on the old Bubble/Laravel build gets re-verified here, not assumed carried over
- [ ] Financials/audit-trail spot check: confirm revenue-by-operator figures are complete now that the transaction gaps from Sprint 3.5 are closed

**Checklist before calling this production-ready for the LSI pilot:**
- [ ] Full PreUAT checklist passed on new stack
- [ ] Side-by-side smoke test against old build for any page where behavior differs
- [ ] Old Laravel/Vite build kept live and untouched as fallback until new stack has run cleanly for a defined period (your call on how long)

## Sprint 7.1: Site-Wide UI→Backend Wiring Audit (raised 2026-07-23, not yet started)

Trigger: found while scoping the Buyer Organization feature (Sprint 6.10) that
`app/signup/page.tsx`'s `company` field (placeholder "Search for company or
Create new") and its `role` selector (Member/Supplier/Both) are both collected
in form state but never sent to `POST /api/auth/register` — the endpoint only
ever accepted `name`/`email`/`password`/`referralCode`, matching the old
Laravel contract. Dead UI, not a stub with a TODO — the kind of gap this
file's own discipline (Sprint 4.5's mock-data audit, the Sprint 1
verifications-tab pullback, the "only delete when superseded" rule) is meant
to catch, but this one slipped through because it was never mock-wired to
begin with, just silently dropped.

- [ ] Fix the specific instance found: wire signup's `company` field + `role`
  selector for real — scope folded into the Buyer Organization build below
  (Member → `BuyerOrganization` search-or-create, Supplier/Both →
  `Company` search-or-create, per the "wire both sides" decision).
- [ ] **Broader audit, not yet started:** grep every page/component for
  patterns that suggest a control collects input but never reaches an API
  call — unused `useState` fields never included in a mutation body, buttons
  with no `onClick`/handler, forms whose `onSubmit` doesn't call `fetch`/a
  React Query mutation, hardcoded `PLACEHOLDER_*`/`TODO` arrays not already
  tracked elsewhere in this file. Distinct from the existing Sprint 4.5 mock-
  data audit (that one covered `lib/mock*.ts` imports specifically) — this is
  broader, covering any dead control regardless of whether it was ever
  backed by mock data in the first place.
- [ ] Every finding gets logged here (or in whichever sprint section it
  belongs to) with the same "flag, don't silently fix or silently ignore"
  discipline as the rest of this file — not batch-fixed without review, since
  some may be intentional (e.g. Sign-out being unwired was already
  flagged and left as a known gap since Sprint 1, not a bug to blindly close).

---

## Notes

- This plan assumes a full-stack rewrite (frontend + backend + auth), not a frontend-only swap onto the existing Laravel API.
- The biggest real risk in this rewrite is not "will Claude Code generate the code" — it's re-verifying auth and money-flow correctness that took a dedicated audit to catch the first time.
- Keep a SPRINT_PLAN.md-equivalent (this file) in the new repo root for Claude Code session context, same convention as before.
